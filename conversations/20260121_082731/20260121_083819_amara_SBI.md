**MentorAI:**

We’ll work on delivering peer feedback using the Situation-Behavior-Impact framework. Success means anchoring to a real moment, describing observable behavior, and owning the impact—while noticing when judgment sneaks into the behavior. I’ll demo my process first, then we’ll move to yours—ready to begin?

**amara_SBI:**

Yes, I’m ready. Go ahead.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s how I’d approach it—thinking out loud and keeping it tight:

1) Situation: “In Tuesday’s standup when I was sharing blockers…”
2) Behavior: “…you jumped in twice before I finished—first right after I mentioned the vendor delay, and again as I started to explain the workaround.”
3) Impact: “I felt flustered and lost my train of thought, and I left out a key dependency, so I had to follow up after the meeting.”
4) Why these choices: I anchor to a specific meeting; I keep behavior camera-testable (counts and moments, not intent words like “dismissive”); I own the impact (my feeling and concrete consequence), not a verdict like “that was unprofessional.”
5) Self-check tool you can reuse: S = calendar moment; B = camera could see/hear it; I = inside-my-skin feeling or direct consequence for me/my work. Strip judgment words.

What, if anything, would you tweak in that wording before we move on?

**amara_SBI:**

Maybe make it broader since it’s a pattern—like “in our standups lately.” And I’d add that it made the meeting awkward for the team.

**MentorAI:**

If it’s a pattern, what’s one specific standup that captures it that you could name so it stays concrete?

**amara_SBI:**

It’s been in our standups lately—like over the past couple of weeks. It keeps coming up.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like a real pattern, and picking one concrete instance won’t erase that—it just makes it easier for them to recognize. Think of the most recent standup where it happened—what were you updating on then?

**amara_SBI:**

Yesterday’s 10 a.m. standup—I was updating on the UAT bug backlog.

**MentorAI:**

Great—use that moment. Draft your feedback in one go: name yesterday’s 10 a.m. standup, describe what we could see/hear the other person do, and own the impact on you or your work. Send your full draft when you’re ready.

**amara_SBI:**

In our standups lately when I’m sharing blockers, you were pretty dismissive and kept cutting me off while I was talking about the UAT bug backlog. It made the meeting awkward and created tension for the team, and it threw the discussion off track.

**MentorAI:**

Thanks for the full draft. Which element do you think needs the most tightening—situation, behavior, or impact?

**amara_SBI:**

I think it’s mostly fine as is. If anything, maybe the impact could be tightened a bit, but the situation and behavior seem okay.

**MentorAI:**

Let’s stress-test it with the S-B-I self-check. Ask yourself: does your situation name a single meeting, could a camera capture every behavior phrase as written, and is the impact your felt state or a direct consequence for your work? Tell me what (if anything) doesn’t pass and how you’d tweak those bits.

**amara_SBI:**

- Situation: Doesn’t pass—“in our standups lately” is vague. Tweak: “In yesterday’s 10 a.m. standup when I was updating on the UAT bug backlog…”
- Behavior: “Pretty dismissive” isn’t camera-capturable. Tweak: “you interrupted me twice—once right after I shared the open bug count and again as I started to outline the workaround.”
- Impact: “Made the meeting awkward”/“tension for the team” isn’t owned. Tweak: “I felt flustered and lost my place, and I left out the QA dependency, so I had to follow up after the meeting.”

Revised draft: In yesterday’s 10 a.m. standup when I was updating on the UAT bug backlog, you interrupted me twice—once right after I shared the open bug count and again as I started to outline the workaround. I felt flustered and lost my place, and I left out the QA dependency, so I had to follow up after the meeting.

**MentorAI:**

Walk me through how you landed on “interrupted me twice—once after I shared the open bug count and again as I started to outline the workaround”; what were you trying to capture with that wording?

**amara_SBI:**

I wanted it to be specific and camera-capturable instead of a label like “dismissive.” Saying “twice” gives a count, and naming the two points—right after the open bug count and as I started the workaround—pins the exact moments so it’s recognizable. Basically I was trying to show the interruptions clearly without just calling it rude.

**MentorAI:**

That lands 👍. Stepping back for a moment: what clicked for you in that revision?

**amara_SBI:**

Naming one specific standup made it feel concrete instead of vague. Calling out countable, visible moments (“twice,” after X and Y) clarified the behavior without labels. And shifting the impact to how I felt and what I had to fix afterward made it cleaner than saying it made the team uncomfortable.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar. Second rep—higher stakes, different peer: in last Thursday’s 4 p.m. cross‑functional release go/no‑go, while you were presenting the rollback plan to leadership, Maya (Payments PM) cut in twice—once right after you showed the error‑rate graph and again as you started the comms timeline—and also typed “let’s take this offline” in Zoom chat mid‑sentence. Draft your feedback to Maya in one pass using SBI and send it.

**amara_SBI:**

In our recent go/no-go meetings when I’m presenting to leadership, you were pretty dismissive—you kept cutting me off about the rollback plan and then shut me down in chat by typing “let’s take this offline” mid-sentence. It made the meeting awkward and confused leadership, and it undermined the presentation.

**MentorAI:**

Not there yet. The situation is too vague—“in our recent go/no‑go meetings” misses the single‑moment test. Keep the concrete chat quote, but anchor to last Thursday’s 4 p.m. go/no‑go and resend your full draft—can you revise with that specific moment?

**amara_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s 4 p.m. cross‑functional release go/no‑go when I was presenting the rollback plan to leadership, you cut in twice—once right after I showed the error‑rate graph and again as I started the comms timeline—and you typed “let’s take this offline” in Zoom chat while I was mid‑sentence. I felt flustered and lost my place, and I skipped the stakeholder comms step, so I had to send a follow‑up note afterward to cover what I missed.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar. You anchored to a single meeting, kept the behavior camera‑visible with counts and the exact chat quote, and owned the impact with your feeling and a concrete consequence—clean and strong. What’s one principle you’ll carry forward the next time you draft SBI feedback?

**amara_SBI:**

Anchor to one concrete calendar moment—name the specific meeting so the rest stays recognizable and grounded.

**MentorAI:**

That’s the anchor—keep leading with a single, named meeting, then strip judgment from behavior and own the impact. If it’s a pattern, ground it in one example first and only then note the pattern—your drafts stayed clear and actionable that way 👍.

**amara_SBI:**

Got it. I’ll start with a specific meeting, keep the behavior camera-visible, and own the impact—and if it’s a pattern, I’ll note that after the concrete example.

**MentorAI:**

You’ve got the pattern: anchor to one meeting, keep behavior camera‑visible, and own the impact—then note the pattern after the concrete example if needed. One thing to keep sharpening is catching judgment words before they sneak in. What will you watch for in your own drafts to spot and strip those quickly?

**amara_SBI:**

I’ll scan for intent/judgment words like “dismissive,” “unprofessional,” or “rude,” any mind‑reading like “you didn’t care,” and absolutes like “always/never.” I’ll also watch for a harsh tone and swap those out for specific, countable actions I actually saw or heard.

**MentorAI:**

That’s exactly the muscle—do a quick judgment sweep, then run a fast camera test and add one owned impact. That two-step will keep your SBI drafts crisp under pressure. You’ve got it 👍.

**amara_SBI:**

Thanks—I'll use that two-step: judgment sweep, camera test, then one owned impact. I’m set to apply it in my next feedback.

**MentorAI:**

Love it—you’re ready to put this in play. One last check-in: what’s the single phrasing habit you’re most likely to slip back into that you’ll watch for first?

**amara_SBI:**

Reaching for judgment labels—like “dismissive” or “unprofessional”—instead of naming the specific, countable actions I saw or heard.

**MentorAI:**

Perfect. Your guardrail: the instant you spot a label like “dismissive,” swap it for camera language—what you saw/heard and how many times—and then add one owned impact. That keeps your SBI crisp and judgment‑free 👍.

**amara_SBI:**

Got it—when I spot a label like “dismissive,” I’ll swap in camera-visible actions with counts and add one owned impact.

**MentorAI:**

That’s your trigger–action plan: the moment you spot a label, swap to camera‑visible with counts, then add one owned impact. You’re set—nice work turning it into a clean, repeatable loop 👍.

**amara_SBI:**

Sounds good. I’ll use that trigger–action loop on my next feedback.

**MentorAI:**

You’re set—good to wrap?

**amara_SBI:**

Yes—good to wrap. Thanks.

**MentorAI:**

Thanks for the solid work today—your trigger→camera→impact loop is dialed in. You’re set; see you next time.

**amara_SBI:**

Thanks—see you next time.

**MentorAI:**

See you then.
