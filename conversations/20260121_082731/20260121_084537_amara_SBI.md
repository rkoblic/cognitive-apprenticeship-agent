**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI. Success means you anchor to a real moment, name only observable behavior, and own your actual impact. I’ll demonstrate how I approach it first—ready to see a quick example?

**amara_SBI:**

Sure, I’m ready. Go ahead with the example.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s how I’d do it and what I’m noticing as I draft: In Tuesday’s standup, when I started sharing the incident summary, you began speaking while I was mid-sentence—twice—and redirected the conversation to sprint goals; I lost my train of thought, felt frustrated, and my update got cut short. I’m anchoring to one meeting, naming only what a camera would catch, and owning my reaction instead of labeling it “rude”—I’m watching for judgment-creep words. What did you notice in that example before we shift to your turn?

**amara_SBI:**

It was tied to one specific meeting. You described exactly what happened—speaking over you twice and switching the topic—rather than calling it something like “rude.” And you said how it affected you (lost your train of thought, felt frustrated) instead of blaming.

**MentorAI:**

Quick check before we shift to your draft. Example: “Lately in our team meetings, you’ve been dismissive, and it makes me feel like you’re undermining me.” What’s the first thing you’d change to move this toward SBI?

**amara_SBI:**

I think it’s mostly fine—maybe just soften the tone a bit so it doesn’t come off too harsh.

**MentorAI:**

Tone tweaks can wait; first we need a solid anchor. Pick one real moment to ground it—what specific meeting would you name?

**amara_SBI:**

It’s been happening lately in our team meetings—like over the past few weeks.

**MentorAI:**

What’s one specific meeting on your calendar where this happened—the last time is fine; what was it called?

**amara_SBI:**

The Weekly Team Sync on Monday at 2pm.

**MentorAI:**

Great—that’s a solid anchor. Draft the feedback you’d give them now: 2–3 sentences that use that meeting, name only what a camera would show, and say your actual impact (how you felt or what happened for you). Write it as you’d say it. Your turn.

**amara_SBI:**

In the Weekly Team Sync on Monday at 2pm, you were dismissive of my update and kept derailing the conversation. You made the meeting awkward and undermined my update, and the team got confused.

**MentorAI:**

Thanks for drafting that. Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back—what in your draft isn’t camera-testable or slips into judgment?

**amara_SBI:**

I think most of it is okay—it’s pretty much what happened. Maybe “awkward” is a little subjective, but otherwise it seems fine to me.

**MentorAI:**

Using this quick self-check—1) single recognizable meeting, 2) behaviors a camera/mic would capture (no labels like “dismissive,” “derailing,” “undermined”), 3) impact in “I” language naming your feeling or direct consequence—what in your draft doesn’t pass, specifically?

**amara_SBI:**

- #1 passes: I named “the Weekly Team Sync on Monday at 2pm.”
- #2 fails: “dismissive,” “kept derailing,” and “undermined my update” are labels, not camera/mic details.
- #3 fails: “You made the meeting awkward” isn’t in “I” language, and “the team got confused” guesses about others instead of naming my feeling or a direct consequence for me.

**MentorAI:**

Can you revise it into 2–3 sentences anchored to that Monday sync, swapping the labels for what you saw/heard and naming how it affected you or what consequence it had for you—write the full draft as you’d say it?

**amara_SBI:**

In the Weekly Team Sync on Monday at 2pm, while I was giving my update, you started talking over me twice and said, “let’s get back to sprint goals,” asking the team to move on. I lost my train of thought, felt frustrated, and ended my update early without covering the vendor risk.

**MentorAI:**

Walk me through your behavior phrasing—“talking over me twice” and the “let’s get back to sprint goals” quote—what were you trying to capture with those choices?

**amara_SBI:**

“Talking over me twice” was to show a concrete, countable action—you started speaking while I was mid-sentence two times, which a camera/mic could capture. Quoting “let’s get back to sprint goals” names the exact words that shifted the topic, so I’m pointing to what was said rather than labeling it as “derailing.”

**MentorAI:**

This mostly lands. One small tighten: “asking the team to move on” reads like interpretation unless those were the exact words—can you swap in the precise quote or just drop that clause? Make that micro-edit and share your tweaked 2–3 sentences.

**amara_SBI:**

In the Weekly Team Sync on Monday at 2pm, while I was giving my update, you started talking over me twice and said, “let’s get back to sprint goals.” I lost my train of thought, felt frustrated, and ended my update early without covering the vendor risk.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—you hit all three criteria 👍

Variation for round two: After last Thursday’s quarterly planning review with the VP in the room, you want to give feedback to Jordan from Sales. During your risk update, Jordan started speaking while you were mid-sentence twice and said, “let’s take this offline,” which shifted the room away from your point. Give me your 2–3 sentence SBI to Jordan as you’d say it.

**amara_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s quarterly planning review with the VP, you were dismissive and kept derailing my risk update—you interrupted me mid-sentence twice and said, “let’s take this offline.” You undermined me in front of the VP and made the room uncomfortable.

**MentorAI:**

Anchor’s strong, and the camera-testable bits are here (the two interruptions and the “let’s take this offline” quote). The gap is impact—“undermined me” and “made the room uncomfortable” are judgments/guesses, not owned language. Replace that with how it hit you in the moment—your feeling or a direct consequence for you—and send the full 2–3 sentences again. Your move.

**amara_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s quarterly planning review with the VP, during my risk update, you started speaking while I was mid-sentence twice and said, “let’s take this offline.” I felt thrown off and frustrated, lost my train of thought, and didn’t finish explaining the vendor exposure.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—you met all three criteria: solid anchor, camera‑testable behavior, and owned impact 👍 What principle from this will you carry forward when you give SBI in the wild?

**amara_SBI:**

Pick one concrete moment, describe only what a camera/mic would capture, and name the impact on me in “I” language instead of using labels.

**MentorAI:**

Takeaway to reuse: run a quick “camera + I” check—one calendar moment, only filmable actions (swap labels for quotes/counts), and an impact that starts with “I”; if any part wobbles, tighten before you deliver 👍

**amara_SBI:**

Got it—the “camera + I” check is clear. I’ll use that to tighten my drafts before I deliver feedback.

**MentorAI:**

Perfect. You’ve got a reliable “camera + I” muscle now—use it and you’ll stay on-target even under pressure. You’re set 👍

**amara_SBI:**

Thanks—I’ll use the “camera + I” check in my next feedback conversations. Appreciate the guidance.

**MentorAI:**

You’re welcome—glad it helped. If you want a quick gut-check on a draft before you deliver, send it my way; otherwise, go make it happen. Sound good?

**amara_SBI:**

Sounds good. I’ll send you a draft if I want a quick check; otherwise I’ll put this into practice.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—I’ll be here when you want a quick check. Anything else you want to lock in before you try it?

**amara_SBI:**

Yeah—two quick ones: If I don’t remember the exact words, is it okay to paraphrase or should I leave that out? And if it’s been a pattern, can I mention that after anchoring to one specific meeting?

**MentorAI:**

Good questions. On wording you don’t remember exactly: only quote if you’re sure; otherwise drop the quotes and paraphrase neutrally (“you said we should take this offline”) or stick to counts/actions (“you started speaking while I was mid‑sentence twice, and then the topic moved to sprint goals”). On patterns: yes—anchor to one meeting first, then mention the pattern with counts/time bounds (“the same thing happened in the last two standups”), and tie it to your impact or a forward-looking ask. Want to try a one‑sentence pattern add‑on you’d use after your anchored SBI?

**amara_SBI:**

This has been happening a lot lately in our meetings, and it’s making the team uncomfortable, so you need to stop doing that.

**MentorAI:**

Good start adding the pattern—let’s tighten “a lot lately,” which is vague. If you swapped that for a concrete count or time window, what would you write (e.g., “in two of the last three syncs”)?

**amara_SBI:**

The same thing happened in two of the last three syncs, and I ended up cutting my update short—can we agree I finish my update before we take follow-ups?

**MentorAI:**

That works: concrete pattern, owned impact, and a clear forward ask 👍 One micro‑tighten if you want it camera‑clean and directed to them: “…can we agree you’ll hold follow‑ups until I finish my update?” Keep yours or swap in that tweak—what feels more natural in your voice?
