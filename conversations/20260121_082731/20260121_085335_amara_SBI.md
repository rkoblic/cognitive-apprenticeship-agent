**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success = a concrete moment, camera-testable behavior, and owned impact—twice: first with support, then solo. I’ll demonstrate how I approach it, then we’ll switch to you—ready to dive in?

**amara_SBI:**

Yep, ready. Go ahead with the demo.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s how I’d approach it, thinking out loud. I’d anchor to one moment and keep behavior camera-testable: “In Tuesday’s standup, when I started my update, you began answering and spoke for about a minute while I was mid-sentence; I stopped speaking. I felt rushed and decided not to raise a blocker, and my task slipped a day.” I chose observable verbs over labels (not “you dominated”), and I owned the impact with my feeling and the direct consequence, not “it was unprofessional.” What stands out to you in that draft?

**amara_SBI:**

It felt really specific—you picked one meeting and described exactly what happened, like speaking for about a minute while you were mid-sentence. You didn’t use labels, and you said how you felt and what the result was. Is that the main idea?

**MentorAI:**

Before I share how I self-check, what 2–3 things would you look for in your own draft to make sure it hits the mark?

**amara_SBI:**

I’d check that my tone sounds respectful and not too harsh, that it doesn’t come across as accusatory, and that it’s short and to the point.

**MentorAI:**

Those are solid style goals. The non‑negotiables I use are: one concrete moment, camera‑testable behavior, and an owned impact—plus a quick scan for judgment sneaking into the behavior. My self-check: 
- Moment: can someone who wasn’t there picture the exact meeting/point? 
- Behavior: would a camera/mic capture what I wrote (verbs, not labels or motives)? 
- Impact: starts with “I,” names my feeling and/or a direct consequence I experienced. 
- Leak scan: replace judgment words (“rude,” “unprofessional,” “always”) with what was seen/heard. 
Ready to try a quick spot-check on an example using this?

**amara_SBI:**

Yep, ready. Share the example and I’ll spot-check it.

**MentorAI:**

Spot-check this against the self-check: “Lately you’ve been really disengaged in meetings; it feels unprofessional and it’s hurting the team’s momentum.” Does this meet the criteria—why or why not?

**amara_SBI:**

I think it mostly meets it—it points to meetings, names the behavior (disengaged), and says the impact (hurting momentum). The only thing I’d tweak is the tone—“unprofessional” might come off a bit harsh. Otherwise it seems fine.

**MentorAI:**

Quick check: does “Lately… in meetings” pass the single‑moment test—could someone picture the exact meeting you mean?

**amara_SBI:**

No—it’s too vague. “Lately… in meetings” doesn’t point to one specific meeting, so someone couldn’t picture the exact moment.

**MentorAI:**

Good catch on the moment. How does “disengaged” fare on the camera test—would audio/video capture that word, or would you need something more concrete?

**amara_SBI:**

I’d need something more concrete—“disengaged” is a label. A camera/mic would catch specifics like not speaking at all, keeping the camera off, looking at a phone, or not responding when asked a question.

**MentorAI:**

Your turn—pick a real, recent moment with a peer (e.g., “in Monday’s design review”) and write it in 2–3 sentences: one concrete moment, camera‑testable behavior, and your owned impact/consequence. Give me the full draft in one go, no bullet points. What’s your draft?

**amara_SBI:**

Lately in our team meetings, you’ve been really disengaged and kind of dismissive when I share updates. It comes across as unprofessional and it’s making the meetings awkward and hurting the team’s momentum.

**MentorAI:**

Thanks for taking a swing. Before I weigh in, what’s the one phrase you think I’ll push back on, and why?

**amara_SBI:**

Probably “unprofessional,” because it sounds harsh and a bit judgey. I could see you pushing back on that tone.

**MentorAI:**

Run the self-check on your draft—moment, behavior, impact, and a leak scan—and tell me what passes and what doesn’t.

**amara_SBI:**

- Moment: I think it passes—“Lately in our team meetings” sets the scene clearly enough.
- Behavior: Passes—I named the behavior as “disengaged and kind of dismissive.”
- Impact: Mostly passes—I explained it’s making meetings awkward and hurting momentum; “unprofessional” might be too strong.
- Leak scan: I’d replace “unprofessional” with something softer, but the rest seems factual.

**MentorAI:**

You marked the moment as passing, but earlier you called “Lately in our team meetings” too vague—what single meeting/moment will you anchor to instead?

**amara_SBI:**

In Monday’s 9am team standup, right when I started my update.

**MentorAI:**

Why that moment—what made you choose Monday’s 9am standup right when you started your update as the anchor?

**amara_SBI:**

It was the most recent instance, and I remember the details clearly—exactly when it happened and what we each did—so it’s easier to make it concrete. It also stood out because it affected how I shared my update that day.

**MentorAI:**

Great—use that anchor. Write your feedback in 2–3 sentences: name Monday’s 9am standup right as you started your update, describe what was seen/heard (no labels), and name your own feeling or direct consequence you experienced. What’s your draft?

**amara_SBI:**

In Monday’s 9am standup, right as I started my update, you began talking and spoke for about a minute while I was mid-sentence, and I stopped. I felt rushed and chose not to raise a blocker, which delayed my task by a day.

**MentorAI:**

If I were to push on one part of your draft, what would it be—and why do you think that might be a weak spot?

**amara_SBI:**

Probably the impact line. “I chose not to raise a blocker, which delayed my task by a day” is a bit generic—I could name the blocker and which task slipped to make the consequence clearer.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar—anchored, camera-testable, and owned impact. Now for a variation: last Thursday’s cross‑functional design review with our Director on the call, and the recipient is a senior PM from another team who cut in as you began presenting. In 2–3 sentences, write your feedback for that situation—what’s your draft?

**amara_SBI:**

Lately in our cross-functional design reviews, especially when leadership is on the call, you’ve been cutting me off and taking over right as I start, which comes across as dismissive. It’s unprofessional and made the Director and the group uncomfortable, and it’s hurting how our teams work together.

**MentorAI:**

Can you anchor this to last Thursday’s cross‑functional design review with our Director—right as you began presenting and the PM cut in—instead of “Lately…,” and rewrite it in 2–3 sentences?

**amara_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s cross‑functional design review with our Director on the call, right as I began presenting, you started speaking and explained the approach for about a minute while I was mid‑sentence, and I stopped to wait. I felt thrown off and skipped the context slide I’d planned, and I didn’t get to ask two questions I had for the group.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—anchored to a specific moment, camera‑testable behavior, and an owned, concrete impact. No judgment leaks, and the stakes are clear without adding heat. That’s it 👍 What principle from this will you carry forward when you’re giving SBI feedback under higher stakes?

**amara_SBI:**

Anchor to one concrete moment, describe only what a camera/mic would capture, and own the impact with “I”—no labels or motives.

**MentorAI:**

That’s the core—you locked onto the control move: pick one moment and write the behavior as if you’re transcribing a recording; the judgment drains out, and your “I” impact stays clean. When the stakes spike, do that first and everything else tends to fall into place. Nicely done today.

**amara_SBI:**

Makes sense. I’ll start by locking to one moment and describing only what a recording would capture, then add my “I” impact. Thanks.

**MentorAI:**

Glad to hear it. Do you want a one-line cue to keep this top of mind, or are you all set?

**amara_SBI:**

A one-line cue would be helpful—please share it.

**MentorAI:**

Pick one moment, describe what a camera would capture (no labels), and name my “I” impact. Does that do the job for you?

**amara_SBI:**

Yes—clear and memorable. That does the job for me, and I’ll use it.

**MentorAI:**

What’s one signal you’ll watch for that tells you judgment is leaking in, so you can swap to camera-capture phrasing?
