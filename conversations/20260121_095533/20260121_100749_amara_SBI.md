**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI in a professional context. Success looks like you producing two complete attempts that anchor to a real moment, name observable behavior, and use owned impact language; the second will be with feedback only. I’ll demonstrate first—ready to dive in?

**amara_SBI:**

Yep, ready. Go ahead.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s a quick model. I’ll use a concrete moment, name only what a camera could capture, and own the impact. Example: “In Tuesday’s standup, while I was sharing the API outage update, you started talking while I was mid-sentence and continued for about a minute; I felt sidelined and lost my train of thought, and I skipped mentioning the rollback plan, so QA didn’t get the heads-up.” My self-check: can I picture the moment, would a camera catch those words/actions, and is the impact something I felt or did.

What do you notice about how the behavior part is phrased?

**amara_SBI:**

It’s very specific and concrete—describes exactly what happened in that moment (“you started talking while I was mid-sentence and continued for about a minute”) without adding judgment or guessing intent.

**MentorAI:**

Quick check: “During Thursday’s design review, you were dismissive about my proposal”—would a camera capture that as written?

**amara_SBI:**

I think so—it seems fine. A camera would catch that they were being dismissive about my proposal.

**MentorAI:**

If you couldn’t use the label “dismissive,” what exact words or actions from that moment would you name instead?

**amara_SBI:**

You shut it down right away and didn’t really take it seriously. You kept brushing off my points and talked over me a lot.

**MentorAI:**

Pick one moment from that review and rewrite “brushing off my points” as something a camera could catch—what exact words did they say while you were speaking?

**amara_SBI:**

While I was explaining the testing plan, you said, “Let’s move on—we don’t need to get into that right now,” while I was mid-sentence.

**MentorAI:**

That’s camera-testable—nice. Ready for a full attempt? Draft the feedback you’d give for that specific moment in Thursday’s design review: anchor the moment, state the observable behavior (like the line you just wrote), and own the impact on you or the work. Write it as you’d say it in a 1:1 and share the full message.

**amara_SBI:**

Hey, I wanted to talk about the design reviews lately. You were pretty dismissive about my proposal and shut it down right away—you kept brushing off my points and talked over me. It made the meeting awkward and you derailed the discussion, and because of that the team missed important details and we lost time.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back on your draft?

**amara_SBI:**

Maybe the tone’s a bit strong, so I could soften a couple words. Otherwise I think it’s mostly fine as is.

**MentorAI:**

Run the self-check on your draft—moment, camera, owned—and tell me which parts pass and which need revision.

**amara_SBI:**

- Moment: Pass — I anchored it to our design reviews lately.
- Camera: Pass — I named what you did (dismissive, shut it down, talked over me).
- Owned: Mostly pass — I explained the impact; I could maybe soften the wording a bit.

**MentorAI:**

Replace “design reviews lately” with a single, named moment—e.g., “In Thursday’s design review”—and re-send your opening line with that anchor.

**amara_SBI:**

Hey, I wanted to talk about Thursday’s design review.

**MentorAI:**

Good anchor. Now let’s tighten the behavior: swap the labels (“dismissive,” “brushing off”) for the exact words you heard in that moment—write one sentence that captures what they said while you were mid-sentence. Can you draft that line now?

**amara_SBI:**

While I was explaining the testing plan, you started talking and said, “Let’s move on—we don’t need to get into that right now,” while I was mid-sentence.

**MentorAI:**

Nice—that line is camera-testable. Now draft the full message as you’d say it in a 1:1 for that exact moment: open with the anchor (“In Thursday’s design review…”), include the behavior in one sentence (the line you wrote), then add the impact in owned language (what you felt or a direct consequence you experienced). Put it all together and share the full message—can you write that now?

**amara_SBI:**

In Thursday’s design review, while I was explaining the testing plan, you started talking and said, “Let’s move on—we don’t need to get into that right now,” while I was mid-sentence. I felt cut off and lost my train of thought, and I skipped the validation steps I planned to cover, so the team left without clarity on test coverage.

**MentorAI:**

You chose “I felt cut off and lost my train of thought”—what were you trying to capture with that impact?

**amara_SBI:**

I was trying to show my personal experience in the moment—being interrupted made me feel cut off—and the immediate effect it had on my contribution: I lost my focus and didn’t cover the testing steps I meant to.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—the moment is concrete, the behavior’s camera-testable, and the impact is owned 👍. Stepping back: what was the hardest part for you to pin down here, and why?

**amara_SBI:**

Turning my interpretation into exact words was the hardest—replacing labels like “dismissive” with what they actually said. I also tend to talk about patterns, so picking one concrete moment instead of “lately” took a bit of effort.

**MentorAI:**

Second rep—variation on yours with higher stakes. You’re giving feedback to your manager: in Monday’s client demo with Acme, while you were answering the client’s question about test coverage, Alex cut in with “I’ll take this one,” talked over you for about 45 seconds, then advanced to the next slide. Write the full message you’d say in a 1:1—anchor the moment, name the observable behavior, and use owned impact language. Share your complete draft.

**amara_SBI:**

Hey, I wanted to talk about our client demos lately. You tend to take over—like with Acme, you cut in with “I’ll take this one,” talked over me for about 45 seconds, then advanced the slide before I could answer. That made me look unprepared and undermined my role with the client; it threw off the flow and caused confusion.

**MentorAI:**

What works: your behavior line is concrete and camera-testable. Where it misses: the impact isn’t owned—“made me look unprepared,” “undermined my role,” and “caused confusion” are judgments or about others’ perceptions, not your felt experience or a direct consequence you experienced. Rewrite the impact so it names what you felt or exactly what you couldn’t do in that moment. Keep the anchor and behavior as-is, and re-send with an owned-impact line.

**amara_SBI:**

Hey, I wanted to talk about our client demos lately. You tend to take over—like with Acme, you cut in with “I’ll take this one,” talked over me for about 45 seconds, then advanced the slide before I could answer. I felt sidelined and lost my train of thought, and I didn’t get to finish answering the test coverage question, so I left without sharing the risk areas we’d flagged.

**MentorAI:**

Almost—your behavior line is solid and the impact is owned. The anchor misses: “our client demos lately” isn’t a single moment. Anchor to the specific demo—e.g., “In Monday’s Acme demo”—and resend the full message with that fix. Can you revise and share it?

**amara_SBI:**

In Monday’s Acme demo, while I was answering the client’s question about test coverage, you cut in with “I’ll take this one,” talked over me for about 45 seconds, then advanced to the next slide. I felt sidelined and lost my train of thought, and I didn’t get to finish answering the test coverage question, so I left without sharing the risk areas we’d flagged.

**MentorAI:**

This meets the bar: clear anchor (Monday’s Acme demo), camera‑testable behavior, and owned impact with a concrete consequence—ready to use as is. What’s one principle you’ll carry forward to keep the impact owned rather than slipping into judgments or others’ perceptions?

**amara_SBI:**

State the impact in first person and tie it to a concrete consequence I experienced—e.g., “I felt X and I couldn’t Y”—and avoid others’ perceptions like “made me look” or “they were confused.”

**MentorAI:**

That’s the right rule of thumb. Keep a quick self-check: if you hear yourself saying “made me look…” or “they were…,” swap to “I felt X, and I couldn’t Y” tied to that moment—you’ll keep the impact owned and specific. You’re set to use this in the wild 👍

**amara_SBI:**

Got it—I’ll use the “I felt X and I couldn’t Y” self-check when I draft feedback. Thanks, I’ll put this into practice.

**MentorAI:**

You’ve got it—keep that self-check in your pocket and you’ll stay owned and specific. Go put it to work 👍

**amara_SBI:**

Will do. I’ll start using it in my next 1:1 and in our next review.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good. One last check—if you catch yourself writing “made me look …” in the impact, what’s your quick swap?

**amara_SBI:**

“I felt [emotion], and I couldn’t [specific thing I needed to do] in that moment,” tied to that exact situation.

**MentorAI:**

That’s it—the swap you named will keep your impact owned; pair it with a single-moment anchor and camera‑testable behavior, and your SBI will land clean 👍. Anything else you want to tune before you take it into your 1:1?
