**MentorAI:**

We’re going to work on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a specific moment, describe only what was observable, and name the impact in your own terms—and we’ll also watch for judgment sneaking into the behavior. I’ll demonstrate first so you can see how I think it through—ready to dive in?

**amara_SBI:**

Yep, ready. A quick demo would help since I haven’t used this framework before.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s a quick demo and how I’m thinking. I pick one concrete moment: Tuesday’s standup. For behavior, I avoid labels like “you interrupted” and stick to what a camera would catch: who spoke when. For impact, I use my own experience and consequence, not a judgment.

Example: “In Tuesday’s standup, when I started my update, you began explaining the database issue and kept talking when I tried to finish. I lost my train of thought and felt flustered, and I skipped key details—so I had to follow up in Slack afterward.”

What stood out or feels unclear before we do a quick check?

**amara_SBI:**

The “camera would catch it” idea stood out. I’m a bit unsure how specific the moment has to be—can I say “in standups lately,” or does it need to be one meeting? And is saying “you interrupted” different from “you kept talking when I tried to finish”?

**MentorAI:**

Good eye on the camera test. Aim for one identifiable meeting (not “lately”)—it’s easier for them to recognize and for you to anchor. And swap labels like “you interrupted” for what happened on the timeline: “you started talking while I was mid‑update and kept going when I tried to finish.” Does that clear it up enough to do a quick check before you try your own?

**amara_SBI:**

Yeah, that clears it up. I’m ready for the quick check.

**MentorAI:**

Quick check: Evaluate this draft—“In last sprint’s design review, you were dismissive about my proposal, and it made me feel it was unprofessional.” Where has judgment leaked in?

**amara_SBI:**

I think it’s fine as written. Maybe the tone is a bit strong, but it reads like what happened and how it made me feel.

**MentorAI:**

The judgment leak is “dismissive”—what did you actually see or hear in that moment (e.g., exact words, interruptions, gestures) that you could name instead?

**amara_SBI:**

You brushed it off and said my proposal wasn’t realistic, basically shutting me down, and you didn’t really look at me while I was explaining.

**MentorAI:**

You’re close. “Said my proposal wasn’t realistic” passes the camera test; “brushed it off” and “shutting me down” are interpretations, and “didn’t really look at me” needs a concrete anchor (e.g., eyes on your laptop). Try rewriting the behavior as one sentence the camera would catch—use the exact words plus a specific nonverbal. What would you write?

**amara_SBI:**

“You said, ‘This proposal isn’t realistic,’ while keeping your eyes on your laptop and continuing to type.”

**MentorAI:**

Can you draft a full SBI message about one identifiable moment with a colleague—name the specific meeting or interaction, describe only what a camera would have caught (exact words or actions), and say the impact on you in your own terms?

**amara_SBI:**

In our team meetings lately, you were pretty dismissive about my updates and kept taking over the conversation. You made the meeting awkward and caused the team to miss important details.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you expect me to push back on this?

**amara_SBI:**

Maybe you’ll say the tone is a little strong or that I could add a bit more detail, but I think it mostly works as is. It says when it happened, what they did, and the impact.

**MentorAI:**

Run the 3-check on your draft—specific moment, camera-test behavior, owned impact—what, if anything, doesn’t meet those?

**amara_SBI:**

I think it mostly meets the three. The moment is our team meetings lately, the behavior is being dismissive and taking over, and the impact is that it made the meeting awkward and the team missed details. Maybe I could name a specific meeting, but overall it seems fine.

**MentorAI:**

Let’s tighten the anchor first: “our team meetings lately” won’t pass the specific‑moment check. Pick one identifiable meeting—e.g., “Monday’s planning meeting” or “last Thursday’s standup”—to ground it. Which single meeting are you choosing?

**amara_SBI:**

It’s been happening in our standups lately—like the recent ones this month.

**MentorAI:**

Pick one standup you can point to—what’s the single meeting you’ll anchor to (e.g., last Thursday’s standup)?

**amara_SBI:**

Last Thursday’s 9:30 a.m. standup.

**MentorAI:**

Great—anchor to last Thursday’s 9:30 a.m. standup and draft your full message: one clear moment, only camera-test behavior (no labels), and your own impact (feeling or consequence). What’s your 2–3 sentence SBI?

**amara_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s 9:30 a.m. standup, when I started my update, you began explaining the vendor issue and kept talking when I tried to finish. I lost my place and felt flustered, and I left out the testing timeline—so I had to follow up in Slack afterward, and it made the meeting awkward.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, what—if anything—would you tighten in your draft, especially around judgment creeping into behavior or whether the impact is fully owned?

**amara_SBI:**

I think it’s mostly solid—I don’t really see judgment in there. Maybe I could tighten the second sentence so it’s shorter, but otherwise it feels fine as is.

**MentorAI:**

Your anchor and behavior land cleanly. One phrase I’m curious about is “made the meeting awkward”—what were you trying to convey with that wording?

**amara_SBI:**

I meant that I felt uncomfortable and rushed after losing my place, and it seemed tense in the room—people went quiet and I worried others were confused.

**MentorAI:**

“Made the meeting awkward” reads like a judgment—swap it for owned impact: name your feelings (you said uncomfortable and rushed) plus the concrete consequence you already had (needing to follow up in Slack), all in one sentence. Your turn—rewrite just the second sentence that way.

**amara_SBI:**

You made me feel uncomfortable and rushed, so I had to follow up in Slack afterward.

**MentorAI:**

Nice tightening. One thing: “You made me feel…” shifts ownership—how would you say it in fully owned language? Try starting with “I felt…” and give me that one sentence.

**amara_SBI:**

I felt uncomfortable and rushed, and I had to follow up in Slack afterward to share the testing timeline I didn’t cover.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—your first attempt meets the bar 👍. Now for a variation: different recipient, higher stakes. In Tuesday’s sprint review with the Director on the call, as you began your test coverage update, your product manager unmuted, started talking about roadmap changes, kept going when you tried to finish, and then moved the meeting to the next item. Write your 2–3 sentence SBI to your product manager—anchor to that moment, stick to camera-test behavior, and own the impact.

**amara_SBI:**

In our sprint reviews lately, you hijacked my test coverage update by talking over me about roadmap changes and then abruptly moving us to the next item. You made me look unprepared in front of the Director and caused the team to miss important details.

**MentorAI:**

Direct feedback: your anchor misses the mark—“in our sprint reviews lately” isn’t a specific moment. Tie it to Tuesday’s sprint review with the Director on the call, then keep the rest as-is for now and resend your 2–3 sentence SBI. Can you revise with that anchor?

**amara_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s sprint review with the Director on the call, you hijacked my test coverage update by talking over me about roadmap changes and then abruptly moving us to the next item. You made me look unprepared in front of the Director and caused the team to miss important details.

**MentorAI:**

Direct feedback: your anchor is solid. The behavior leaks judgment—“hijacked” and “abruptly”—so rewrite that as camera-test actions/words. The impact isn’t owned—“You made me look unprepared” is about appearance and blames; replace with your feelings and/or a concrete consequence you experienced. Revise to 2–3 sentences and resend—can you give it another pass?

**amara_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s sprint review with the Director on the call, as I began my test coverage update, you unmuted and started talking about roadmap changes; when I tried to finish, you kept talking and then moved the meeting to the next agenda item. I felt flustered and frustrated, and I skipped the coverage gaps and had to follow up in Slack afterward.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—clear moment, camera-test behavior, and fully owned impact. You’re meeting the bar 👍. What’s one principle you’ll carry forward to keep your next SBI this tight?

**amara_SBI:**

Use the camera test for behavior—stick to exact words/actions, not labels.

**MentorAI:**

Strong principle. Keep pairing your camera‑test behavior with a single named moment and fully owned impact; if a word judges or blames (e.g., “dismissive,” “hijacked,” “made me”), rewrite it into exact words/actions or “I felt…/so I…”—that keeps your SBIs tight and hard to argue with.
