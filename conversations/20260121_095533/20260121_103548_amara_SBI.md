**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a specific moment, describe observable behavior, use owned impact language, and can spot where judgment creeps in. I’ll model my approach first, then you’ll try—ready to begin?

**amara_SBI:**

Yep, I’m ready. I haven’t really used this framework before, so I’ll follow your lead.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s how I’d handle it. Imagine Tuesday’s standup: after I said “the integration test failed again,” Jordan cut in mid-sentence and spoke over me twice; I anchor to that moment, then name only what a camera would catch—“you jumped in with questions and spoke over me twice while I was still answering,” not “you dismissed me.” For impact, I keep it owned and immediate: “I lost my train of thought, felt flustered, and skipped two updates; I had to follow up afterward in DMs.” The key decisions: pick one recognizable moment, strip out motives/adjectives, and keep the impact in my body or workload—not a judgment like “it was unprofessional.” I’ll pause there—ready to take a swing with a real moment from your world?

**amara_SBI:**

It’s been happening in our standups lately—pretty regularly.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—patterns happen, but for SBI we need one concrete instance. Can you pick one specific standup (say yesterday’s or Tuesday’s) and draft your feedback in 2–3 sentences—name that meeting, describe only what was seen/heard, and say how it affected you?

**amara_SBI:**

In our standups lately, you’ve been dismissive of my updates and cut me off. You didn’t seem to care about what I was saying and took over the discussion. It made the meeting awkward and you created tension for the team.

**MentorAI:**

Before I give feedback, where do you think this misses our criteria—specific moment, camera-test behavior, or owned impact?

**amara_SBI:**

I think it’s mostly fine. Maybe I could be clearer on the exact timing, but the behavior and impact seem okay to me.

**MentorAI:**

Let’s run a quick self-check—answer yes/no for each: 1) Is it anchored to one identifiable standup (e.g., “yesterday’s standup”)? 2) Are the behaviors camera-testable (no motives like “dismissive,” just what was said/done)? 3) Is the impact your felt state or a direct consequence you experienced (not a judgment about the meeting)? What do you get for each, and where’s the first “no”?

**amara_SBI:**

1) No — I said “in our standups lately,” not one identifiable standup.
2) No — I used “dismissive” and “didn’t seem to care,” not observable actions.
3) No — I said the meeting was awkward and you created tension, not my felt state or a direct consequence.

The first “no” is #1.

**MentorAI:**

Good catch on all three. Let’s fix the first “no” only: pick one recognizable standup you can point to. Which one is it, and can you open your draft with that (e.g., “In yesterday’s standup…”)?

**amara_SBI:**

Yesterday’s standup. In yesterday’s standup…

**MentorAI:**

Great—now draft the whole thing in 2–3 sentences: anchor to “yesterday’s standup,” describe only what a camera would catch (exact words/actions), and name your owned impact (how you felt or a direct consequence for you). Give it a try.

**amara_SBI:**

In yesterday’s standup, while I was sharing my updates, you cut me off and took over the conversation—you were dismissive and spoke over me twice while I was still answering. It made the meeting awkward and you caused confusion for the team.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, predict where I’ll push back: which exact words in your draft aren’t camera-testable or aren’t owned impact—call them out explicitly.

**amara_SBI:**

“Dismissive” isn’t camera-testable. And “made the meeting awkward” probably isn’t owned impact.

**MentorAI:**

Good eye on those two. Let’s tighten the behavior next. Walk me through “took over the conversation”—what concrete action are you trying to capture there that a camera would show?

**amara_SBI:**

I mean you cut in mid-sentence, then started talking to the team with your plan and kept going for a few minutes, so I didn’t finish my update—you kind of took control of the discussion.

**MentorAI:**

You’ve got the raw pieces—use them. Swap “dismissive”/“took over” for concrete actions: you cut in while I was mid‑sentence, spoke over me twice, then presented your plan for a few minutes, and I didn’t finish my update. Keep “In yesterday’s standup…” and leave the impact line as-is for now. Your turn to rewrite just the behavior sentence using those specifics.

**amara_SBI:**

In yesterday’s standup, you cut in while I was mid-sentence, spoke over me twice, then presented your plan for a few minutes, and I didn’t finish my update.

**MentorAI:**

Nice—now let’s replace your impact line with owned language. In that moment, what did you feel or what direct consequence did you deal with personally (not “for the team”)? Write one sentence that names that.

**amara_SBI:**

You made the meeting awkward and caused confusion for the team.

**MentorAI:**

This is the spot that trips people up—your line talks about the meeting and the team, not you. In that moment, what did you feel or what direct consequence did you personally deal with—put it in one sentence that starts with “I …”?

**amara_SBI:**

I lost my train of thought and felt flustered, and I had to follow up with the rest of my update after the meeting.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—anchored to a real moment, camera-test behavior, and owned impact. What, if anything, was the hardest part to write here?

**amara_SBI:**

The impact line was the hardest—I kept wanting to say what it did to the meeting or the team instead of what I felt. Second was turning “dismissive/took over” into concrete actions and sticking to one specific standup.

**MentorAI:**

Second rep—higher stakes. Variation: last Thursday’s client kickoff on Zoom with Acme, your manager Priya cut in during your update in front of the client and Sales. Draft your full 2–3 sentence SBI to Priya.

**amara_SBI:**

Lately in our client kickoffs on Zoom, including the Acme one, you were dismissive and cut me off during my update. You took over the conversation and didn’t seem to respect my role in front of the client and Sales. It felt unprofessional and you made the client uncomfortable.

**MentorAI:**

First gap: it’s not anchored to one identifiable moment—“Lately… including the Acme one” diffuses it. Pin it to Thursday’s Acme kickoff on Zoom and resend your full 2–3 sentences. Your turn.

**amara_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s Acme kickoff on Zoom, while I was giving my update, you cut me off and took over the conversation—you were dismissive and didn’t seem to respect my role in front of the client and Sales. It felt unprofessional and you made the client uncomfortable.

**MentorAI:**

Anchor’s solid—“last Thursday’s Acme kickoff on Zoom” works. The behavior line still carries judgment/inference: “dismissive,” “didn’t seem to respect my role,” and “took over the conversation” aren’t camera‑testable. Replace those with only what you saw/heard (exact interruptions, who was speaking, for how long). Keep the situation the same and resend your full 2–3 sentences with that behavior tightened.

**amara_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s Acme kickoff on Zoom, while I was giving my update, you cut in mid-sentence, then interrupted again about a minute later; you spoke to the client and Sales for roughly three minutes, and I didn’t finish my update. It felt unprofessional and you made the client uncomfortable.

**MentorAI:**

Anchor and behavior are on target. Impact misses: “It felt unprofessional” is a judgment, and “you made the client uncomfortable” is mind‑reading. Revise the impact to name your felt state or a direct consequence you personally dealt with, then resend your full 2–3 sentences.

**amara_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s Acme kickoff on Zoom, while I was giving my update, you cut in mid-sentence, then interrupted again about a minute later; you spoke to the client and Sales for roughly three minutes, and I didn’t finish my update. I felt flustered and lost my train of thought, and I had to email a follow-up after the call to share the rest of my update.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar—anchored to a specific kickoff, observable behavior only, and owned impact. What’s the one principle you’ll carry forward to keep judgment and mind‑reading out of your behavior and impact lines, especially when the stakes are high?

**amara_SBI:**

One rule: if a camera/mic wouldn’t capture it—or I can’t start the impact with “I…”—it doesn’t go in.

**MentorAI:**

That’s the principle—use your “camera/I” test as a quick gate before you speak or send: if a neutral observer could verify the behavior and you can start the impact with “I…,” you’re in bounds; if not, swap intent words for verbs or name a personal consequence instead. You’ve got it—carry that forward 👍

**amara_SBI:**

Got it. I’ll use the camera/I test as my quick gate and swap intent words for verbs or a personal “I…” consequence before I give feedback.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—you’re ready to use it in the wild. Want one last lightning rep to lock it in, or wrap here?

**amara_SBI:**

One last lightning rep works—ready when you are.

**MentorAI:**

Lightning rep: yesterday in the #launch-planning Slack thread, after you posted the risk list and mitigations, Sam replied “this feels alarmist” with a 🤷‍♂️ emoji, @-mentioned the channel, and started a sub-thread proposing to skip two mitigations. Draft your 2–3 sentence SBI to Sam—anchor to that thread, name only what was written/done, and use an “I…” impact. Your turn.
