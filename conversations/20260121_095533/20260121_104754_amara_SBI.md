**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means naming a specific moment, describing camera-testable behavior, and using owned impact language; you’ll do two full attempts. I’ll model first to show my thinking—ready to start?

**amara_SBI:**

Yep, I’m ready. Go ahead and model it, and I’ll follow along.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s a concrete example, thinking out loud: I anchor to one moment—“In Tuesday’s standup right after Nora’s update…” Then I stick to what a camera could capture—“you began talking while I was mid‑sentence twice and suggested switching the deployment plan.” I name my impact in owned terms—“I felt flustered, lost my place, and we ran about four minutes over.” I’m deliberately avoiding intent or labels like “dismissive” or “unprofessional”—that’s where judgment creeps in. Before I share my own self-check, what would you look for to tell if this follows SBI well?

**amara_SBI:**

I’d just see if it sounds respectful and not harsh. If it feels clear and concise, I’d assume it follows the framework pretty well.

**MentorAI:**

Tone and concision help the relationship, but SBI asks for a few tighter checks. Here’s the quick self-check I use: 1) Is the moment pinned to one recognizable instance? 2) Is the behavior camera‑testable (what was said/done, not why)? 3) Is the impact owned and about my state or a direct consequence to me/my work? 4) Quick leak sweep: did any intent labels or judgments sneak in (e.g., “rude,” “unprofessional”)? Want to try that on a quick example before we move to your first attempt?

**amara_SBI:**

Sure, I can try that. Do you have a quick example for me to check with your list?

**MentorAI:**

Try this: “In Wednesday’s client prep right after Lena asked for risks, you seemed irritated and kept checking Slack on your laptop. I felt it was unprofessional.” Using the checklist, what passes and what fails—and why?

**amara_SBI:**

- Moment: Passes—it names Wednesday’s client prep and a specific point after Lena’s question.
- Behavior: Seems fine—you say they kept checking Slack and seemed irritated, which sounds clear enough.
- Impact: Passes—you used “I felt,” so it’s owned.
- Leak sweep: Looks okay to me—doesn’t sound judgmental.

**MentorAI:**

Almost—one key miss: the impact doesn’t pass. “I felt it was unprofessional” is a judgment dressed as a feeling; owned impact is your emotion/physical state or a direct consequence to you/your work. How would you rewrite the impact line so it’s owned?

**amara_SBI:**

You made the meeting feel awkward and unprofessional, and it distracted the team from planning.

**MentorAI:**

If you make that impact owned, what did you personally feel or what concrete effect did it have on your own work in that moment—put it as one “I …” sentence?

**amara_SBI:**

I felt distracted and tense, and I lost my train of thought while taking the risk notes.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—owned impact with a concrete consequence to your work 👍. Let’s move to your first full attempt: pick one real moment, describe the camera‑testable behavior, and state your owned impact in 2–4 sentences. What’s your draft?

**amara_SBI:**

In our weekly planning meetings lately, you’ve been dismissive of my timeline and haven’t really taken the risks seriously. You keep pushing back without listening. You made the meeting awkward and threw the team off track.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you think this draft misses the SBI bar—pick the one part that feels weakest to you and say why.

**amara_SBI:**

The impact line feels the weakest to me—it sounds a bit harsh, like “you made the meeting awkward,” so I’d probably soften the tone there. Otherwise it seems pretty clear.

**MentorAI:**

Let’s run your draft through the 4-step SBI self-check: 1) one recognizable moment, 2) camera-testable behavior, 3) owned impact, 4) leak sweep for judgments/intent. Briefly note what passes and what fails for each part—and why. Your turn.

**amara_SBI:**

1) Moment: Passes — “in our weekly planning meetings lately” feels specific enough.
2) Behavior: Passes — saying you were dismissive and kept pushing back sounds clear about what happened.
3) Impact: Passes — it states the meeting got awkward and off track, which is a clear consequence.
4) Leak sweep: Looks fine — no harsh labels like “rude” or “unprofessional,” so I think it’s okay.

**MentorAI:**

First place to tighten is the moment: “lately” spans multiple meetings, but SBI needs one identifiable instance—which specific planning meeting and moment inside it would you anchor to instead, and can you rewrite your opening line to name that?

**amara_SBI:**

In a recent planning meeting when we were talking about the timeline, you…

**MentorAI:**

Anchor it to a single meeting by naming the day (e.g., “Monday’s planning”) and keep your “when we were talking about the timeline” trigger. Share that one revised opening line.

**amara_SBI:**

In Monday’s planning meeting, when we were talking about the timeline, …

**MentorAI:**

Good—now for the behavior, translate “dismissive/pushing back” into what a camera would catch in that moment: what exact words or actions did you see/hear (e.g., quotes, interruptions, gestures)? Draft one sentence starting with “you …” that names 1–2 specifics, no labels—what’s your line?

**amara_SBI:**

You began talking while I was mid‑sentence twice and said, “We can deal with risks later—let’s just commit to the shorter timeline.”

**MentorAI:**

Nice—clear, camera-testable behavior. Now close it with owned impact: in that moment, what you felt or the direct effect on your work. Draft one sentence starting with “I …” that names your emotion and/or concrete consequence. Your line?

**amara_SBI:**

I felt you made the meeting awkward and derailed my update.

**MentorAI:**

Can you rewrite it to own the impact—drop “you made” and state what you personally felt plus the concrete effect on your work in that moment, as one “I …” sentence?

**amara_SBI:**

I felt flustered and lost my train of thought, and I skipped two risk items in my notes.

**MentorAI:**

Good—owned and concrete. Pull it together now as a single 2–3 sentence SBI message, using that specific moment, the camera‑testable behavior, and your owned impact. How would you say it end to end?

**amara_SBI:**

In Monday’s planning meeting, when we were talking about the timeline, you began talking while I was mid‑sentence twice and said, “We can deal with risks later—let’s just commit to the shorter timeline.” I felt flustered and lost my train of thought, and I skipped two risk items in my notes.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the SBI bar—clear moment, camera-testable behavior, owned impact. Let’s raise the stakes for round two: It’s your manager. During Thursday’s external client kickoff, right as you began the risk overview, they spoke over you and said, “Let’s park risks for later—let’s keep this upbeat for the client.” Write your full 2–4 sentence SBI message.

**amara_SBI:**

In our client kickoffs lately, you’ve been pretty dismissive and shut me down when I try to cover risks. On Thursday you did that again and pushed to keep things upbeat instead of letting me do the overview. You made the meeting feel awkward for the client and undermined me in front of them.

**MentorAI:**

What works: you name Thursday. The miss to fix first: you drift from a single moment—“in our client kickoffs lately” and “did that again” broaden it and break SBI’s one‑instance rule. Revise so the whole message anchors only to Thursday’s kickoff and that specific moment. Give me your rewritten 2–3 sentence SBI message focused just on Thursday.

**amara_SBI:**

In Thursday’s external client kickoff, right as I began the risk overview, you spoke over me and said, “Let’s park risks for later—let’s keep this upbeat for the client.” I felt flustered and hesitant to continue, and I lost my place and skipped two risk items I’d prepared.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the SBI bar: one clear moment (Thursday’s kickoff), camera‑testable behavior (spoke over you + exact quote), and owned impact with a concrete consequence to your work—well done 👍. Looking back, what principle from this will you carry forward into future feedback?

**amara_SBI:**

The one‑instance rule: anchor feedback to a single, recognizable moment. It keeps me focused on camera‑testable behavior and owned “I” impact instead of slipping into labels.

**MentorAI:**

Exactly—that anchor is your guardrail. Keep using the quick self-check (one moment, camera-testable behavior, owned “I” impact, leak sweep) and you’ll stay out of labels and in useful feedback. Nice work today.

**amara_SBI:**

Got it—I’ll use that self-check to keep it anchored and specific. Thanks for the help.

**MentorAI:**

You’re welcome—keep that self-check handy; it travels well. If a tricky case comes up later, bring it back and we can sharpen it. Nice work today.

**amara_SBI:**

Will do. I’ll bring any tricky cases back next time.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—I’ll be here. Before next time, pick one upcoming meeting where you can use SBI; got one in mind?
