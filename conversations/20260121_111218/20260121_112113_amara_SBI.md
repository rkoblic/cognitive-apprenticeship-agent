**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback with SBI. Success means you anchor to a real moment, describe only observable behavior, and name the impact in your own words—and you can spot when judgment sneaks into the behavior. I’ll demonstrate first to show my thinking; ready to dive in?

**amara_SBI:**

Yep, I’m ready. Go ahead.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s a quick model so you can see the moves. In Tuesday’s standup when I started sharing the rollout plan, you jumped in twice while I was mid-sentence and finished my points. I felt flustered and lost my place, and I had to re-explain parts, which added about two minutes.

Why I made those choices: I anchored to a single, recognizable moment; I described only what a camera would catch (“jumped in twice while I was mid-sentence”), avoiding labels like “dismissive”; and I used owned impact—my feeling and a concrete consequence I experienced. Self-check I use: 1) Is the moment specific? 2) Would a camera confirm the behavior? 3) Is the impact my feeling or a direct consequence to me? Red flags I watch for: adjectives about character, mind-reading motives, or fuzzy words like “unprofessional,” “always,” or “seemed.”

What stood out to you in that, before we try yours?

**amara_SBI:**

The “camera would catch it” idea stood out—that made the behavior really concrete. Also, anchoring it to Tuesday’s standup instead of saying “you always” made it clearer. And the “I felt flustered” part felt different from how I’d usually say it.

**MentorAI:**

Love that—those are the core moves. Try this quick check: “In yesterday’s retro, when Alice was sharing, you cut in four times while she was mid-sentence and later said ‘we already tried that’ in a sharp tone. It felt unprofessional and made the team feel dismissed.” Pick one phrase in that draft that violates the criteria and say how you’d change it to meet SBI.

**amara_SBI:**

Maybe “cut in four times” is a bit harsh. I’d change it to “cut in a few times” to make it sound less intense.

**MentorAI:**

Try this: swap “It felt unprofessional” for your own internal state or a direct consequence you experienced—what would you write instead?

**amara_SBI:**

You made the meeting awkward and created tension.

**MentorAI:**

In that moment, what did you personally feel or have to do as a result—put it in “I” language and try that line again.

**amara_SBI:**

I felt uncomfortable and distracted, and I had to pause the discussion to ask for one person to speak at a time.

**MentorAI:**

Great—now your turn. Think of a real moment with a peer and write the full SBI message you’d say to them—2–3 sentences that name the specific moment, describe only what a camera would catch, and use “I” language for your impact. What’s your draft?

**amara_SBI:**

In our team meetings lately, you’ve been dismissive during my updates—you keep talking over me and shutting my ideas down. It made the meeting awkward and you made the team feel frustrated.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, pick one spot you think I’ll push on—what in your draft might miss the criteria?

**amara_SBI:**

I think it’s mostly okay—maybe “made the meeting awkward” is a bit strong. I could change it to “it was a little awkward.”

**MentorAI:**

Let’s run the self-check you noticed earlier: does your draft anchor to one recognizable moment, stick to camera-testable behavior, and name impact in “I” language or a direct consequence to you—what passes, and what would you change?

**amara_SBI:**

- Anchor: Doesn’t pass. I’d change “In our team meetings lately” to “In Monday’s 9am team meeting during my roadmap update.”
- Behavior: Mixed. “Dismissive” and “shutting my ideas down” aren’t camera-testable. I’d use “you talked while I was mid-sentence twice and said ‘let’s move on.’”
- Impact: Doesn’t pass. I’d switch to “I felt flustered and lost my place, and I had to repeat part of my update.”

**MentorAI:**

Nice self-check—that’s the move. Stitch those changes into a 2–3 sentence message you’d actually say to them and share the full draft. What’s your revised SBI?

**amara_SBI:**

In Monday’s 9am team meeting during my roadmap update, you started speaking while I was mid-sentence twice and then said “let’s move on.” I felt flustered and lost my place, and I had to repeat part of my update.

**MentorAI:**

Walk me through your phrasing for the behavior—what were you trying to capture with “started speaking while I was mid-sentence twice and then said ‘let’s move on’”?

**amara_SBI:**

I was trying to capture two concrete things: that you began talking while I was still mid-sentence—and that it happened twice—and then the exact words “let’s move on,” which shut the topic down. I picked that wording to avoid labels like “dismissive” and keep it camera-testable. Is “started speaking while I was mid-sentence” the right level of specificity, or would you phrase that differently?

**MentorAI:**

Your phrasing is at the right level—camera-testable and specific. If you want it tighter, try: “you spoke over me twice while I was mid-sentence, then said ‘let’s move on.’” Which version do you want to use in your final draft?

**amara_SBI:**

I’ll use your tighter version: “you spoke over me twice while I was mid-sentence, then said ‘let’s move on.’”

**MentorAI:**

Using this higher-stakes variation—In Thursday’s client QBR on Zoom, while you were presenting the risk mitigation slide, Jordan, the Sales Director from Sales, spoke over you twice mid-sentence and said “let’s move on”—what 2–3 sentence SBI would you say to Jordan?

**amara_SBI:**

In our client QBRs lately, you’ve been pretty dismissive during my sections—you keep interrupting and shutting the discussion down. It came off as unprofessional and made the client and the team uncomfortable.

**MentorAI:**

This misses the specific moment—“in our client QBRs lately” is too vague. Anchor it to the one we set: Thursday’s client QBR on Zoom while you were on the risk mitigation slide. Rewrite your 2–3 sentence message to Jordan anchored to that moment and share it.

**amara_SBI:**

In Thursday’s client QBR on Zoom, while I was presenting the risk mitigation slide, you spoke over me twice while I was mid-sentence and then said “let’s move on.” I felt flustered and lost my place, and I had to backtrack to clarify the plan, which disrupted the flow and added about a minute.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—clear anchor to Thursday’s QBR, camera-testable behavior, and owned impact with a concrete consequence and time cost. You meet the criteria; if you want to tighten, you could trim “while I was mid-sentence,” but it’s fine as is. What principle from this will you carry forward next time you give feedback?

**amara_SBI:**

Use the camera test—describe only what a camera would capture. It keeps the feedback specific and less likely to trigger defensiveness.

**MentorAI:**

💡 Keep turning the camera test into a habit: if you catch yourself writing an adjective about their behavior, swap it for a direct quote, a simple count, or a visible action. You’ve got the muscle—use it with one anchored moment and “I” impact and you’ll stay both clear and fair.

**amara_SBI:**

Got it. I’ll swap adjectives for a quote, count, or visible action, anchor to one moment, and use “I” impact next time.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—you’re set. Nice work today 👍

**amara_SBI:**

Thanks. I’ll practice using the camera test with a specific moment and “I” impact.

**MentorAI:**

What’s one upcoming conversation this week where you’ll use the 10‑second self-check—one anchored moment, camera-test behavior, and “I” impact?

**amara_SBI:**

Probably in our team standup later this week—I’ll use it when I give feedback about the handoff updates.

**MentorAI:**

What single recognizable moment will you anchor to in that standup—name it in one sentence now.

**amara_SBI:**

In our next team standup when we get to the handoff updates.

**MentorAI:**

Good—now pin it to one moment, not the whole segment. Fill this in for your case: “In that standup, when [person] was giving the [specific handoff] update…”—what goes in the brackets?

**amara_SBI:**

In that standup, when Maya was giving the dev-to-QA handoff update for the invoice-generation feature…

**MentorAI:**

Good—clear, single moment. Now write the 2–3 sentence message you’d say to Maya, describing only what a camera would catch and using “I” for the impact. What’s your draft?

**amara_SBI:**

In that standup during the dev-to-QA handoff for the invoice-generation feature, you were dismissive and kept cutting me off while I was trying to explain the risks. It made the update awkward and you made the team feel ignored.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, pick one phrase in your draft that you think violates the criteria—either not camera-testable or not in “I” impact—and say why you think it misses.
