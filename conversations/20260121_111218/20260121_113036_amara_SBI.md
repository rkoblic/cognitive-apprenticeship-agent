**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success looks like two clean drafts anchored to a real moment, describing observable behavior and your owned impact—and you’ll be able to spot when judgment creeps in. I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll practice—ready to start?

**amara_SBI:**

Yep—ready to start.

**MentorAI:**

Great—here’s a quick demo. Scenario: giving a peer feedback right after Tuesday’s standup. “In Tuesday’s standup, during your update, you spoke for about seven minutes without pausing or handing off. I felt anxious watching the time and we ran out of space for two blockers I needed to raise.”

What I’m doing: I anchored to a single, recognizable moment (not “lately”); I made the behavior camera-testable (“spoke for ~7 minutes without pausing,” not “you were rambling”); and my impact is owned (“I felt anxious” and a concrete consequence), not a judgment like “it was unprofessional.” What did you notice about the choices I made there?

**amara_SBI:**

You tied it to a specific moment—Tuesday’s standup. You described exactly what happened—spoke for about seven minutes without pausing—instead of calling it something. And you said how it affected you—“I felt anxious”—plus the concrete consequence about running out of time.

**MentorAI:**

Nice read. Before we practice, what quick self-check would you run on your own draft to confirm it hits a real moment, camera-testable behavior, and owned impact?

**amara_SBI:**

I’d just read it over to see if it sounds okay—like not too harsh—and if it feels clear, then I think it’s fine.

**MentorAI:**

Watching tone is good; add a quick 4-point check you can run in 20 seconds: 1) Calendar-able moment, 2) Camera-test behavior, 3) Owned impact (my feeling or a consequence I experienced), 4) No labels/motives or “always/should” language. Ready for a quick test on a sample line before you draft?

**amara_SBI:**

Yes—ready.

**MentorAI:**

Try your 4-point check on this: “In last Thursday’s client call, you were unprepared and kept dodging questions, which made me feel it was unprofessional.” Using your check, does this pass—and if not, what’s the first thing you’d change?

**amara_SBI:**

It doesn’t pass. First change: swap “unprepared”/“dodging” for camera-testable actions—for example, “when asked about the timeline and pricing, you said ‘I’m not sure’ three times and didn’t open the deck with the agreed details.”

**MentorAI:**

Your turn: pick a real, specific moment with a peer (e.g., a particular meeting) and write a complete feedback draft—1–3 sentences that name the moment, describe the observable behavior, and state your owned impact. Send it as you’d actually say it, all together.

**amara_SBI:**

Lately in our team meetings, you’ve been pretty dismissive and keep derailing the conversation. It made the meeting awkward and you caused us to miss important points.

**MentorAI:**

Using your 4-point check, where do you predict I’ll push back—what’s the single biggest miss in your draft?

**amara_SBI:**

Biggest miss: it isn’t anchored to a calendar-able moment—“Lately in our team meetings” is vague. You’d push me to pin it to a specific meeting.

**MentorAI:**

Run your 4-point check on your draft—moment, camera-test behavior, owned impact, no labels/motives—and tell me what, besides anchoring the moment, doesn’t pass.

**amara_SBI:**

Beyond the moment, the behavior isn’t camera-testable—“dismissive” and “derailing” are labels. The impact isn’t owned: “made the meeting awkward” and “you caused us to miss” blame and don’t state my feeling or a consequence I personally experienced. It also uses label/frequency language (“dismissive,” “keep”), which breaks the “no labels/always” check.

**MentorAI:**

Good diagnosis. Now rewrite it: pick one identifiable meeting and draft 1–3 sentences using your 4-point check, in your natural voice. Send the full revised draft.

**amara_SBI:**

In Monday’s 10:00 standup, while I was giving the QA timeline update, you spoke while I was mid-sentence twice and started a side thread about design handoffs. I felt thrown off and lost my place, and we didn’t get to the two risks I needed to flag.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, what’s the one place you think I’ll push back on in this draft?

**amara_SBI:**

You’ll probably push on “started a side thread about design handoffs”—that’s a bit label-y. You’d want me to name what I actually saw/heard (who you spoke to and the specific question you asked).

**MentorAI:**

Run your 4-point check on this draft and name the one item, if any, that doesn’t pass.

**amara_SBI:**

Camera-test behavior. “Started a side thread about design handoffs” isn’t fully observable—I'd name the specific action/quote (e.g., who you spoke to and what you asked). Everything else passes.

**MentorAI:**

Good catch. Replace “started a side thread about design handoffs” with what you actually saw/heard—who you addressed and the words you used—and keep everything else the same. Make that swap and send the full revised draft.

**amara_SBI:**

In Monday’s 10:00 standup, while I was giving the QA timeline update, you spoke while I was mid-sentence twice and then turned to Alex and said, “Can we review the design handoff dates now?” I felt thrown off and lost my place, and we didn’t get to the two risks I needed to flag.

**MentorAI:**

That lands 👍 Ready for round two—here’s the variation: In Thursday’s 3:00 pm client kickoff on Zoom with Northstar Co., your manager Sam spoke over you twice while you were presenting the QA risks slide and said, “Let’s skip ahead—Alex, can you walk us through design handoffs?” Write the 1–3 sentences you’d actually say to Sam using SBI, all together.

**amara_SBI:**

Lately in our client calls, you’ve been undermining me by talking over me and taking over my presentation. It made the meeting feel unprofessional and you caused confusion for the client by skipping important QA risks.

**MentorAI:**

Anchor to a single, calendar-able moment—use Thursday’s 3:00 pm Northstar kickoff with Sam—then resend your full 1–3 sentences to him.

**amara_SBI:**

Sam, in Thursday’s 3:00 pm client kickoff with Northstar on Zoom, while I was presenting the QA risks slide, you spoke over me twice and said, “Let’s skip ahead—Alex, can you walk us through design handoffs?” I felt thrown off and concerned, and I didn’t get to cover the two QA risks and mitigations we’d planned to walk through.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar: specific moment, camera‑test behavior, owned impact, no judgment leakage. What’s one principle from this draft you’ll carry forward when giving feedback up the chain?

**amara_SBI:**

Stick to what I saw and heard, not labels or motives—name the specific moment and actions, then share my impact.

**MentorAI:**

Lock that in as your rule of thumb: start with a calendar-able moment, describe what the camera would’ve caught, and own your impact—if a word feels like a label, swap it for the exact words or actions you heard/ saw. Nice work—this is feedback people can actually use. Sound good?

**amara_SBI:**

Sounds good—I’ll use that rule of thumb going forward.

**MentorAI:**

That’s the muscle to keep: real moment + camera-caught behavior + owned impact—and when emotions spike, catch any labels and swap them for the exact words/actions you saw. You’re set—nice work 🎯

**amara_SBI:**

Got it. I’ll stick to that formula and watch for labels—I'll try it in my next standup.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—love the plan. Before that standup, what’s one specific label you tend to use that you’ll replace with a camera-test description?

**amara_SBI:**

I tend to say “dismissive.” I’ll swap that for “you didn’t seem to care about my point and brushed it off.”

**MentorAI:**

Right now “didn’t seem to care” and “brushed it off” are still interpretations—thinking of one standup, what exact words or actions did you hear or see that made it land that way?

**amara_SBI:**

In one standup, you were pretty dismissive—you cut me off, had a condescending tone, and basically said we don’t need to get into that, then moved on to the next topic.

**MentorAI:**

What were the exact words they used in that moment—put them in quotes?

**amara_SBI:**

“Hold on—we don’t need to get into that right now; let’s move on.”

**MentorAI:**

Using that quote, write the one behavior sentence you’d use instead of “dismissive”—capture the interruption (if you were mid‑sentence) and the exact words you heard; what would you write?
