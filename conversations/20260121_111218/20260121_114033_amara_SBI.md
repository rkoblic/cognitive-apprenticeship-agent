**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI at work. Success means you anchor to a real moment, describe camera-testable behavior, use owned impact language, and can spot where judgment creeps in. I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll practice—ready to dive in?

**amara_SBI:**

Yep, I’m ready. I’m not super familiar with this yet, so a quick demo sounds helpful.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s a quick demo you can hear: “In Tuesday’s standup when I was sharing the Q2 roadmap, you jumped in while I was mid-sentence and then spoke over me when I tried to finish. I felt flustered and lost my place, and I skipped flagging a blocker.” I anchored to a recognizable moment, stuck to camera-testable actions (interrupting, speaking over), and owned the impact with my feeling plus a concrete consequence—no labels like “unprofessional” or “always.” Before we practice, how would you check your own draft to keep it tight to SBI?

**amara_SBI:**

I’d read it out loud and make sure the tone doesn’t sound harsh, maybe remove words like “always” or “never.” If it sounds respectful and not too long, I’d figure it’s tight enough.

**MentorAI:**

Good instincts—reading aloud, nixing “always/never,” and keeping it tight all help. Here’s a quick SBI self-check you can run before tone: 1) Moment test—can I point to a specific meeting/time? 2) Camera test—are my verbs observable, no labels? 3) Ownership test—does the impact name my feeling/body state or a direct consequence I experienced? 4) Judgment leak scan—any adjectives/adverbs like “rude,” “unprofessional,” or generalizations sneaking into the behavior? Would you use that as your quick checklist?

**amara_SBI:**

Yes, that works for me. Moment, camera, ownership, and judgment leak—I can use that as a quick checklist before I give feedback.

**MentorAI:**

Quick check: Evaluate this draft—“Lately in meetings you’ve been dismissive, and it’s making the team less motivated.”—using the checklist; what’s the single biggest miss here and why?

**amara_SBI:**

I think the main miss is the tone—it sounds a bit harsh. I’d soften “dismissive” so it doesn’t come off so strong, and otherwise it seems okay.

**MentorAI:**

Not tone—the biggest miss is the situation. “Lately” fails the moment test; without a concrete meeting/time, it reads like a generalization. If you were fixing just that opener, what specific moment would you anchor it to?

**amara_SBI:**

In our recent team meetings.

**MentorAI:**

Closer, but “recent team meetings” is still a blur. Pick one recognizable calendar moment—think title and when, like “Tuesday’s standup,” “last Thursday’s product sync,” or “yesterday’s 1:1.” Which exact meeting would you anchor to?

**amara_SBI:**

Last Thursday’s product sync.

**MentorAI:**

In 2–3 sentences, could you draft an SBI for a real moment this week—name the specific meeting, describe the camera-testable behavior, and state your owned impact (feeling or direct consequence)?

**amara_SBI:**

Lately in our team meetings, you’ve been dismissive of my ideas and kept interrupting. You made the meeting awkward, and people were less motivated to speak up. It created tension that slowed us down.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, which part of your draft do you think misses our checklist—moment, camera, ownership, or judgment leak?

**amara_SBI:**

I think the main miss is ownership—where I said “You made the meeting awkward.” I’d change that to how I felt, and otherwise it seems fine.

**MentorAI:**

Do a quick pass with the checklist—moment, camera, ownership, judgment leak—and call out one phrase you’d revise for each from your draft.

**amara_SBI:**

- Moment: “Lately in our team meetings”
- Camera: “dismissive of my ideas”
- Ownership: “You made the meeting awkward”
- Judgment leak: “It created tension that slowed us down”

**MentorAI:**

For that last Thursday’s product sync, what did they actually say or do—something we could see or hear, like a specific quote or a countable interruption—that led you to read it as “dismissive”?

**amara_SBI:**

They were pretty dismissive and brushed off my point with a condescending tone. It felt like they didn’t really care about what I was saying and kind of shut the idea down.

**MentorAI:**

This is the spot that trips people up—“condescending” and “didn’t care” are interpretations, not things a camera could capture. Let’s translate tone into behavior: pick one concrete anchor—exact words (or a close paraphrase), how many times they cut in while you were speaking, or a specific nonverbal like an eye roll plus a laugh. From last Thursday’s product sync, what’s the closest you can recall—one short quote/paraphrase and whether they interrupted you mid-sentence?

**amara_SBI:**

They cut in twice while I was mid-sentence. The closest quote I recall is, “Let’s move on—this isn’t a priority right now.”

**MentorAI:**

Great—those are concrete. Using them, draft your full message in 2–3 sentences: anchor to last Thursday’s product sync, describe the two mid-sentence cut-ins and the “Let’s move on—this isn’t a priority right now” line, and name your own impact (feeling or direct consequence you experienced). Your turn.

**amara_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s product sync, while I was walking through the rollout plan, you cut in twice while I was mid-sentence and said, “Let’s move on—this isn’t a priority right now.” I felt thrown off and lost my place, and I skipped flagging the risk dependencies I was about to share.

**MentorAI:**

Before I give feedback, where do you think I’d push back—name a specific phrase or which checklist item (moment, camera, ownership, judgment leak) still feels shaky?

**amara_SBI:**

Maybe ownership—“I felt thrown off” might be a bit strong, so I could soften that. Otherwise, it seems fine to me.

**MentorAI:**

Run your quick checklist on that draft—moment, camera, ownership, judgment leak—and tell me if any of them wobble; if so, name the exact word or phrase you’d change.

**amara_SBI:**

- Moment: Solid — “In last Thursday’s product sync.”
- Camera: Slight wobble — change “cut in” to “interrupted me twice mid-sentence.”
- Ownership: Solid — “I felt thrown off… I skipped flagging the risk dependencies…”
- Judgment leak: No leaks — no labels or generalizations.

**MentorAI:**

What led you to choose “interrupted me twice mid-sentence” over labels like “dismissive”—what were you aiming to capture with that specific phrasing?

**amara_SBI:**

I wanted to name exactly what happened in a way you could see or hear, so “interrupted me twice mid-sentence” is specific and countable. It avoids labeling intent like “dismissive” and keeps the focus on the action that threw me off. It also makes it clearer how that behavior led to my impact.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—your draft meets all four checks. What, if anything, clicked for you while writing it that you’ll carry into future feedback?

**amara_SBI:**

Picking one concrete meeting made the rest a lot easier to write. Using a quote and countable interruptions kept me out of labels, and naming my own feeling plus the direct consequence made the impact clearer. I’ll carry those three steps forward.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s your variation—different recipient, higher stakes: In Tuesday’s cross-functional launch review with the VP Sales present, your marketing counterpart Priya cut in while you were walking through the risk-mitigation slide, spoke over you twice, and said, “This seems overkill—can we move on?” Draft a 2–3 sentence SBI message you’d say to Priya—anchor to that moment, stick to those camera-testable actions, and own your impact (feeling and/or direct consequence). Your turn.

**amara_SBI:**

Lately in our cross-functional launch reviews, you’ve been pretty dismissive and talked over me while I was walking through the risk‑mitigation slide. You made the meeting awkward, especially with the VP Sales there, and it derailed the discussion. It felt like you were undercutting the work and people got confused.

**MentorAI:**

Biggest miss: the moment. “Lately…” fails the moment test and blurs the feedback—anchor to Tuesday’s cross‑functional launch review. Please revise your 2–3 sentence message to that specific meeting, sticking to camera‑testable actions and your owned impact. Your turn.

**amara_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s cross-functional launch review with the VP Sales present, while I was walking through the risk‑mitigation slide, you cut in and spoke over me twice and said, “This seems overkill—can we move on?” I felt thrown off and rushed, and I skipped outlining the contingency steps I needed to share.

**MentorAI:**

That lands 👍 You’ve got a clear moment (Tuesday’s review with VP Sales), camera‑testable behavior (spoke over you twice plus the quote), and owned impact (felt thrown off/rushed and skipped the contingency steps)—no judgment leaks. If you want to tighten, you could swap “cut in and spoke over me twice” for “interrupted me twice while I was mid‑sentence” to remove a bit of redundancy, but it’s solid as written. 

Say “ready” and we’ll wrap with one quick reflection.

**amara_SBI:**

ready

**MentorAI:**

Looking back on both attempts, what felt hardest in the moment—picking the exact situation, keeping behavior camera‑testable, or owning impact—and what’s your move to handle that next time under pressure?

**amara_SBI:**

Anchoring to one exact moment was the hardest—I keep wanting to say “lately.” Next time I’ll pause and write the calendar label first (e.g., “Tuesday 2pm launch review”), then jot one observable action/quote and finish with “I felt X, and Y happened,” before I say anything.

**MentorAI:**

Takeaway: lead with the calendar label, then one camera‑testable action or quote, then your owned impact—those three beats will keep you out of “lately” and judgment when it’s tense. You’ve got a repeatable move you can trust under pressure. Nice work today 👍
