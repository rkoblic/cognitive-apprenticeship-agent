**MentorAI:**

We’ll work on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework, with success defined as a concrete moment, camera-testable behavior, and impact in your own words—plus you spotting where judgment might leak in. I’ll demonstrate first so you can see how I think it through. Ready for the demo?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yeah, go ahead. Make it quick.

**MentorAI:**

Quick demo, then I’ll hand it to you: “In Tuesday’s standup, when you spoke over me twice while I was outlining the deployment issue and started proposing fixes before I finished, I lost my train of thought and felt rushed, and we missed the SSL cert detail so we had to circle back later.” I anchored to a specific moment, described camera-visible actions (counts and sequence) instead of labels like “dismissive,” and named my actual impact (emotion + concrete consequence). I watch where judgment wants to sneak in and swap it with counts, quotes, or specific actions. What did you notice there?

**carlos_SBI:**

You were specific about the moment, you counted the interruptions, and you said the impact in your own words instead of labels. Looks fine. Ready to do mine.

**MentorAI:**

Quick check before your turn. Evaluate this: “In last Thursday’s design review, you were dismissive of my proposal and shut it down for no reason, which made me feel it was unprofessional.” What’s the biggest miss against SBI here?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me. It’s clear enough.

**MentorAI:**

Imagine a video of the review with the sound transcribed—what specific words in that draft couldn’t be verified by a neutral observer watching the footage?

**carlos_SBI:**

Probably “dismissive.” Maybe “for no reason.” Same thing though.

**MentorAI:**

Convert those judgment words into camera-visible behavior: what did they do or say in that moment (e.g., exact words, a count of interruptions, a quote) that made it land as “dismissive/for no reason”? Write that behavior line.

**carlos_SBI:**

Behavior: You were dismissive and shut it down immediately, wouldn’t listen, and shot it down before I finished.

**MentorAI:**

You’re close—“before I finished” is observable, but “dismissive / wouldn’t listen / shot it down” are judgments. What exact words did they say when they cut in—put that quote into your behavior line and share it back.

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine. Behavior: You cut in with “This won’t work”—something like that—and moved on before I finished. Same thing.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like this is a bit frustrating—the swap from labels to specifics can feel nitpicky, but it’s the muscle. Drop “something like that” and pick the closest exact wording you remember—what words should we put in quotes for when they cut in?

**carlos_SBI:**

Behavior: You cut in with “This won’t work” before I finished.

**MentorAI:**

Give me your full SBI for a specific real moment—name the meeting/moment, the exact words or action (e.g., the “This won’t work” line), and the impact on you (emotion or concrete consequence)—what’s your one-sentence draft?

**carlos_SBI:**

In last week’s design review, you were dismissive and shut it down, saying “This won’t work” before I finished, which made the meeting awkward and caused delays.

**MentorAI:**

Before I give feedback, what phrase in your draft do you think I’ll flag as judgment rather than camera-visible behavior?

**carlos_SBI:**

Probably “dismissive.”

**MentorAI:**

Yep—“dismissive” is the leak. Now run the owned-impact check on your last clause: replace “made the meeting awkward/caused delays” with either an emotion in I-language or a concrete consequence you experienced. Rewrite your one sentence with that adjusted impact and share it.

**carlos_SBI:**

In last week’s design review, you shut it down, saying “This won’t work” before I finished, and I felt rushed.

**MentorAI:**

What in your behavior line is still judgment rather than camera-visible—and how would you rewrite the sentence without that phrase?

**carlos_SBI:**

“Shut it down” is judgment. Rewrite: In last week’s design review, you said “This won’t work” before I finished, and I felt rushed.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar 👍. Second practice—variation: this time you’re giving feedback to your direct report. In Tuesday’s client call with Acme, while you were outlining migration risks, they cut in with “We’ll take this offline” and moved the conversation to pricing in front of the client. Give me your one‑sentence SBI.

**carlos_SBI:**

On the Acme client call this week, you were unprofessional and cut me off with “We’ll take this offline” and moved the conversation to pricing in front of the client, which made the call awkward and created problems.

**MentorAI:**

Your moment is specific and the quote helps; two misses: “unprofessional” is a judgment (not camera‑visible), and “made the call awkward/created problems” isn’t owned impact—name how you felt or a direct consequence you experienced. Revise by removing the judgment and swapping the impact to I‑language or a concrete consequence, then share your one sentence.

**carlos_SBI:**

Okay. On the Acme client call this week, you cut me off with “We’ll take this offline” and moved to pricing in front of the client, and I felt frustrated.

**MentorAI:**

That lands: specific moment, camera‑visible behavior with the quote, and owned impact. One tighten for next time—anchor to the actual day (“on Tuesday’s Acme call”) instead of “this week” to remove ambiguity. What principle will you carry forward from this about keeping judgment out of the behavior line?

**carlos_SBI:**

Use quotes or counts instead of labels—no “unprofessional,” just the exact words/actions. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

That principle is the core. Takeaway: when a judgment pops up (“unprofessional,” “dismissive”), translate it into a quote or a count, plus one I‑statement about the impact on you. You’ve got it—nice work.

**carlos_SBI:**

Got it. Are we done?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—nice work today 👍. We’re done.

**carlos_SBI:**

Cool.

**MentorAI:**

Anytime—ping me when you want to practice more SBI.

**carlos_SBI:**

Sure.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—I’ll be here when you want to run another SBI rep. Anything else you need right now?

**carlos_SBI:**

No, I’m good.

**MentorAI:**

Alright—catch you next time. Ping me whenever you want to run another SBI rep.

**carlos_SBI:**

Yep.

**MentorAI:**

👍 See you next time.

**carlos_SBI:**

Later.
