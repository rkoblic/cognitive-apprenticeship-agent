**MentorAI:**

We’re focusing on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a specific moment, name observable behavior (no judgments), state your own impact clearly, and can spot where judgment creeps in. I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll practice with your situation—ready to start?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yeah. Let’s make it quick.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—quick demo, then your turn. In Tuesday’s standup after eng updates, you spoke over me twice while I was mid-sentence; I lost my train of thought and felt deflated, and we spent extra time because I had to restart. Why this works: one clear moment, camera-test behavior (spoke over me twice), owned impact (I lost my train, I felt deflated)—no judgments like “unprofessional.” My quick self-check before sending: time anchor, camera test, and “I” impact. Ready to draft yours?

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week. In our team meeting.

**MentorAI:**

Can you draft the whole thing in 1–2 sentences—name the exact moment in that team meeting, the camera-test behavior you saw/heard, and your “I” impact?

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in our team meeting, you were dismissive and talked over people. It was awkward and slowed things down.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back in your draft—and why that spot? Pick one thing.

**carlos_SBI:**

Probably “dismissive”—you’ll say that’s a judgment. Looks fine otherwise.

**MentorAI:**

Run the quick self-check we used: time anchor, camera-test behavior, and “I” impact—what in your draft passes, and what needs revision?

**carlos_SBI:**

Time anchor passes (“last week in our team meeting”). Behavior passes (“talked over people”). Just drop “dismissive.” Impact looks fine; if you need an “I,” I can tack it on, but it’s basically the same.

**MentorAI:**

What did you personally feel or have to do in that moment—put it as an “I” statement and rewrite your impact line.

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine: “I felt annoyed and we lost time.” Done?

**MentorAI:**

I hear the “let’s be quick” vibe—you’re close. Can you put the whole thing together now in 1–2 sentences, keeping the meeting anchor, the camera-test behavior (no “dismissive”), and your “I” impact?

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in our team meeting, you talked over people a couple times. I felt annoyed and we lost time.

**MentorAI:**

You’re close—what made you choose “talked over people a couple times” for the behavior—were you trying to capture one clear instance or the pattern?

**carlos_SBI:**

Pattern. It’s been happening in meetings—“a couple times” covers it without getting into one exact moment.

**MentorAI:**

In that meeting, what’s one specific moment you can point to—e.g., during whose update—when it happened, so we can anchor your behavior to that single instance?

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week during the updates—don’t remember who exactly. It was in that section.

**MentorAI:**

Makes sense—locking to one moment can feel annoying when the details are fuzzy; you don’t need the exact speaker, just a recognizable anchor. Pick the clearest 10-second window you remember from that meeting and tie it to the topic being discussed (e.g., the Q3 launch or Jira blockers). What topic do you remember from the moment they cut in?

**carlos_SBI:**

Blockers. During the blockers section last week.

**MentorAI:**

Good—“during the blockers section last week” is a solid anchor. Draft the full feedback in 1–2 sentences for one clear moment in that section: name what they did that we could see/hear and your “I” impact. Can you write it?

**carlos_SBI:**

During the blockers section last week, you kept talking over me while I was explaining my Jira blocker. I felt annoyed and it slowed the meeting because I had to repeat myself.

**MentorAI:**

Nice—tight and specific. Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back—what’s the one phrase you’re least sure about?

**carlos_SBI:**

“Kept talking over me.” You’ll say it sounds like a pattern. The rest looks fine.

**MentorAI:**

You’re right—that “kept” reads like a pattern. Lock it to the moment by swapping in a concrete count for that window (e.g., “twice”) and keep the rest as-is. Make that edit and share the revised 1–2 sentences.

**carlos_SBI:**

During the blockers section last week, you talked over me twice while I was explaining my Jira blocker. I felt annoyed and it slowed the meeting because I had to repeat myself.

**MentorAI:**

This lands. One small tighten: “it slowed the meeting” reads like an evaluation—make the impact fully owned by sticking to what you felt or directly had to do (e.g., “I had to repeat myself,” or “we spent extra time”). Make that tweak and share your final 1–2 sentences.

**carlos_SBI:**

During the blockers section last week, you talked over me twice while I was explaining my Jira blocker. I felt annoyed and had to repeat myself.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar 👍. Now for a variation: In Friday’s cross‑functional review on Zoom, while you were walking through your Jira blocker, your manager jumped in and answered over you twice with the VP listening. Write your 1–2 sentence SBI to your manager—specific moment, camera‑test behavior, and your “I” impact—what do you say?

**carlos_SBI:**

On Friday’s cross‑functional review on Zoom, you were dismissive and answered over me twice while I was walking through my Jira blocker with the VP there. It was awkward and created confusion.

**MentorAI:**

What’s working: the anchor is clear, and “answered over me twice” is observable. The gap: your impact isn’t owned—“It was awkward and created confusion” isn’t an “I” statement. Rewrite just the impact as what you felt or had to do in that moment, then share the updated 1–2 sentences.

**carlos_SBI:**

**MentorAI:**

Anchor and count are solid, and your impact is owned. The miss is “dismissive”—that’s a judgment; stick with the observable “answered over me twice.” Cut the judgment and share your final 1–2 sentences.

**carlos_SBI:**

On Friday’s cross‑functional review, you answered over me twice while I was walking through my Jira blocker. I felt awkward and had to repeat myself. Good?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—this meets the bar: specific anchor, camera‑test behavior, and owned impact. Nice work tightening without the judgment. What was the hardest part to get right here, and what will you carry forward next time?

**carlos_SBI:**

Nothing was really hard—just dropping “dismissive” and adding the “I felt” bit. I’ll stick to a quick anchor, what you did on camera, and my “I” impact next time. Can we wrap?

**MentorAI:**

You’ve got the core move. Takeaway: when a judgment word pops up (dismissive, unprofessional), swap it for what was seen/heard—ideally with a simple count—and keep the impact in “I” language. You’re set—nice work today.

**carlos_SBI:**

Sounds good. I’m all set.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—if you want a quick sanity check on an SBI later, send it over. Good to close here?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yep, good to close. I’m all set.

**MentorAI:**

All set—closing here. You’ve got the move; ping me anytime for a quick SBI check.
