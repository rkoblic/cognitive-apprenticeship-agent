**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI, with success defined as a real moment for the situation, camera-testable behavior, owned impact, and spotting when judgment leaks in. I’ll demonstrate how I approach it first, then we’ll shift to your practice. Ready to begin?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yeah, go ahead. Let’s keep it quick.

**MentorAI:**

Quick model: “In Tuesday’s standup, while I was walking through the timeline, you started talking over me twice. I lost my train of thought and felt rushed, and we ran out of time before I could raise two blockers.” I anchored to a single meeting, kept the behavior camera-visible (“talking over me twice”), and owned the impact (“I lost my train of thought,” “I felt rushed,” plus a concrete consequence), avoiding judgments like “unprofessional.” Ready to try your own draft?

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in meetings, you were unprofessional—kept interrupting and talking over people. It was awkward and caused problems.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you think I’d push back in that draft—what’s most likely off against the SBI bar?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me. Nothing major. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Got it—you want this efficient, and we can keep it tight while still hitting the bar. Quick self-check: looking at your draft, which element is weakest—the specific moment, the camera-visible behavior, or the owned impact?

**carlos_SBI:**

If anything, the specific moment. But “last week in meetings” is close enough. What’s next?

**MentorAI:**

“Last week in meetings” isn’t a single moment—pick one meeting you both remember and name it; which specific meeting are you pointing to?

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine—last week’s standup. Same thing. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you want to keep this moving—we can do it in two sentences. Using “last week’s standup” as the anchor, give me a full draft in one go: what I could’ve seen on a camera, and what you felt or what directly happened for you. Your turn.

**carlos_SBI:**

In last week’s standup, you were dismissive and kept talking over me and others. It was awkward and we ran out of time.

**MentorAI:**

Fast check: which phrase in your draft would fail the camera test—something you couldn’t literally see or hear on a recording? Your call.

**carlos_SBI:**

“Dismissive.” Let’s keep going.

**MentorAI:**

Good catch on “dismissive.” One more tighten: “It was awkward” isn’t owned—replace it with what you actually felt or directly experienced (e.g., “I felt rushed” or “I lost my train of thought”), then share the revised two-sentence draft. Your turn.

**carlos_SBI:**

In last week’s standup, you were dominating the conversation and kept talking over me when I was giving my update. I felt rushed and we ran out of time before I could cover the last points.

**MentorAI:**

Quick check: which phrase in your behavior line still wouldn’t show up clearly on a recording?

**carlos_SBI:**

“Dominating the conversation.”

**MentorAI:**

Nice. Drop “dominating the conversation” and make the behavior countable: try “talked over me twice during my update.” Plug that in and share your two-sentence draft again.

**carlos_SBI:**

In last week’s standup, you talked over me twice during my update. I felt rushed, it was awkward, and we ran out of time before I could cover the last points.

**MentorAI:**

Almost there—one thing to tighten 🔧: “it was awkward” isn’t owned. Replace it with what you actually felt or experienced (or cut it), then share your revised two-sentence draft. Your turn.

**carlos_SBI:**

In last week’s standup, you talked over me twice during my update. I felt rushed, and we ran out of time before I could cover the last points. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

That lands—meets the SBI bar. Quick why: what made you choose “talked over me twice during my update” as your behavior phrasing? What were you aiming to capture with that choice?

**carlos_SBI:**

Because it’s clear and countable—shows you cut me off twice during my update. Simple and to the point. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Before we move on, quick step back: what single principle from this pass will you carry into future feedback—say it in your own words?

**carlos_SBI:**

Make the behavior camera-visible and countable. That’s it. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Variation for round two: In Friday’s Acme client demo, your manager jumped in while you were answering a question and promised GA by Q2 without checking with the team. Give me a tight two-sentence SBI draft—anchor to that moment, make the behavior camera-visible, and own the impact. Your turn.

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in the Acme client demo, you were unprofessional and steamrolled me by promising GA by Q2 without checking with the team. It was awkward and caused problems with the client.

**MentorAI:**

Direct call: judgment leaked. “Unprofessional” and “steamrolled” aren’t camera-visible—drop them and stick to what was said/done (promised GA by Q2, cut in while you were answering). Keep the same moment. Give me a revised two-sentence draft with behavior phrased as what I could’ve seen or heard. Your turn.

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine—In Friday’s Acme client demo, you cut in while I was answering the client’s question and promised GA by Q2 without checking with the team. It was awkward and created confusion with the client.

**MentorAI:**

Anchor and behavior land. Impact doesn’t: “It was awkward” and “created confusion with the client” aren’t owned. Replace that with what you actually felt or a direct consequence you personally experienced, then share the two-sentence revision. Your turn.

**carlos_SBI:**

In Friday’s Acme client demo, you cut in while I was answering the client’s question and promised GA by Q2 without checking with the team. I felt sidelined and had to scramble, and it put me in a bad spot. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

I hear you want to keep this tight—we’re very close. Suggestion: make “without checking with the team” camera-visible to that moment (e.g., “without asking us during the call”), then share your two-sentence revision. Your turn.

**carlos_SBI:**

In Friday’s Acme client demo, you cut in while I was answering the client’s question and promised GA by Q2 without asking us during the call. I felt sidelined and had to scramble, and it hurt our credibility. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Anchor and behavior are solid. One miss: “it hurt our credibility” isn’t owned—it’s a judgment about the situation, not your felt state or a consequence you personally experienced. Replace that with something you felt or directly dealt with, then share the two-sentence revision. Your turn.

**carlos_SBI:**

In Friday’s Acme client demo, you cut in while I was answering the client’s question and promised GA by Q2 without asking us during the call. I felt sidelined and had to scramble, and it caused issues. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Tight and close. Anchor and behavior are solid; “I felt sidelined and had to scramble” is owned. “and it caused issues” isn’t—it’s vague and not owned. Cut it or replace it with a specific effect you personally felt or had to handle, then share the revised two-sentence draft. Your turn.

**carlos_SBI:**

In Friday’s Acme client demo, you cut in while I was answering the client’s question and promised GA by Q2 without asking us during the call. I felt sidelined and had to scramble. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

That lands—meets the SBI bar. What was the single hardest part of drafting this second one?

**carlos_SBI:**

Owning the impact—saying what I felt instead of “it caused issues.” Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Takeaway: when you catch yourself writing “it was awkward/caused issues,” translate it into what you personally felt or had to do (“I felt sidelined,” “I had to scramble”) to keep the impact owned. Good to wrap here?
