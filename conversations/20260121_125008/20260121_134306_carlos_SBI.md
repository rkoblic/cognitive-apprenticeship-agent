**MentorAI:**

We’re going to practice delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success looks like naming a specific moment, describing only observable behavior, and owning your impact with your actual feeling or consequence. I’ll demonstrate first—ready to jump in?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yep. Go ahead—let’s keep it quick.

**MentorAI:**

Quick model: I’m choosing Tuesday’s standup because it’s a single, recognizable moment; I’ll keep the behavior camera-testable and own my impact. “In Tuesday’s standup, when I started outlining the API plan, you began talking while I was mid-sentence twice; I lost my train of thought, felt flustered, and we had to circle back after the meeting.” Notice I didn’t say “rude” or guess motives—just what happened and what it did to me. My fast self-check: moment specific, behavior observable, impact owned. Your turn—draft one from your world in one or two sentences, all three parts together.

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in meetings, you were dismissive and unprofessional; it made things awkward and created problems.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back against the criteria here—moment specificity, camera-testable behavior, or owned impact?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me. If anything, maybe you'd nitpick the moment, but it's clear.

**MentorAI:**

Run the 3‑point self-check on your sentence and tell me pass/fail for each: 1) specific recognizable moment vs. a span, 2) camera-testable behavior (no labels), 3) owned impact (your feeling or direct consequence to you). What do you get?

**carlos_SBI:**

1) Pass. 2) Pass. 3) Pass.

**MentorAI:**

Let’s zero in on one thing. If we watched a recording of one specific meeting from last week, what would we actually see or hear that you’re calling “dismissive”—what did they do or say?

**carlos_SBI:**

They cut me off—jumped in while I was talking. Same thing. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Got it—you want to keep this tight; this part trips people up, and you’re close. Pick one specific meeting from last week and rewrite the whole message in 1–2 sentences: name that meeting, describe the observable “you started talking while I was mid‑sentence” behavior, and state your impact on you (feeling or consequence). What’s your revised draft?

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in standups, you started talking while I was mid-sentence and were pretty dismissive; it was awkward and we had to circle back.

**MentorAI:**

You’re close—one piece still isn’t meeting the bar. If I push on one thing first, which do you think it is: the time anchor (“last week in standups”), the label (“pretty dismissive”), or the impact phrase (“it was awkward/we had to circle back”)?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me. If you want to nitpick, maybe the time anchor—but it’s clear. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

I hear you want to move fast—totally fair. One tighten we can’t skip: “last week in standups” is a span, not a single moment, so it won’t meet the bar. Swap it for one specific meeting (e.g., Tuesday’s standup or your 1:1 on Thursday) and resend the sentence with just that change 🔧. What’s your revised line?

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine: In Tuesday’s standup, you started talking while I was mid-sentence and were pretty dismissive; it was awkward and we had to circle back.

**MentorAI:**

I hear the “fine”—this polish step is annoying, and you’re very close. Can you drop the label “were pretty dismissive” and resend the full line with Tuesday’s standup, the mid‑sentence interruption, and your impact?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, you started talking while I was mid-sentence; it was awkward and we had to circle back.

**MentorAI:**

Nice tighten. One last piece: “it was awkward” isn’t owned. What were you actually feeling or what direct consequence did you personally experience—put that in first person (e.g., “I felt flustered” or “I lost my train of thought”)? What’s that phrase for you?

**carlos_SBI:**

I felt like it derailed things.

**MentorAI:**

You’re right on the edge—“I felt like it derailed things” points at the meeting, not you. What did you actually experience in that moment—either a specific feeling (e.g., embarrassed, tense) or a direct consequence to you (e.g., I lost my train of thought)—which one fits?

**carlos_SBI:**

I lost my train of thought.

**MentorAI:**

Great—that’s concrete and owned. Put it all together now in one or two sentences using Tuesday’s standup, the mid-sentence interruption, and “I lost my train of thought.” What’s your full line?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, you started talking while I was mid-sentence; I lost my train of thought and it was awkward.

**MentorAI:**

This is close. What were you aiming to communicate by adding “and it was awkward”?

**carlos_SBI:**

Just that it made the meeting awkward. Same point. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

I hear you want to keep this moving—you’re 95% there. One quick tighten that matters: “and it was awkward” isn’t owned; your owned impact is “I lost my train of thought.” Drop the awkward line and resend the full sentence. What’s it read now?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, you started talking while I was mid-sentence; I lost my train of thought.

**MentorAI:**

That lands 👍. Let’s level it up: you’re giving feedback to your manager after Thursday’s client QBR with NovaTech on Zoom—during your roadmap section, they started talking while you were mid-sentence twice. Draft your feedback in 1–2 sentences with all three parts together: the specific moment, the observable behavior, and your owned impact.

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in the NovaTech QBR, you were dismissive and talked over me during my roadmap; it was awkward and created problems.

**MentorAI:**

Let’s keep it tight. First miss: the time anchor—“last week in the NovaTech QBR” is a span, not a single moment. Use the specific moment (e.g., Thursday’s client QBR with NovaTech on Zoom) and resend the full line with that change. What’s your revision?

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine: In Thursday’s client QBR with NovaTech on Zoom, you were dismissive and talked over me during my roadmap; it was awkward and created problems.

**MentorAI:**

The moment lands—good. The impact misses the bar: “it was awkward and created problems” isn’t owned. Replace that with your actual feeling or a direct consequence you experienced, then resend 1–2 sentences. What’s your revision?

**carlos_SBI:**

Okay: In Thursday’s client QBR with NovaTech on Zoom, you were dismissive and talked over me during my roadmap; I felt frustrated.

**MentorAI:**

Situation is specific—good. Impact is owned—good. Behavior partially misses: “dismissive” is a judgment, not camera-testable; “talked over me” is fine. Drop the label (or replace it with what you actually saw) and resend 1–2 sentences. What’s your revision?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Thursday’s client QBR with NovaTech on Zoom, you talked over me during my roadmap; I felt like it derailed things.

**MentorAI:**

Situation and behavior meet the bar. Impact misses—“I felt like it derailed things” points at the meeting, not you. Replace it with an owned impact (a feeling or a direct consequence you experienced), then resend 1–2 sentences. What’s your revision?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Thursday’s client QBR with NovaTech on Zoom, you talked over me during my roadmap; I lost my train of thought.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar: specific moment, camera-testable behavior, and an owned impact—clean and direct. Nice work. What’s one principle you’ll carry forward the next time you give SBI feedback?

**carlos_SBI:**

Name the exact moment. That’s what I’ll focus on next time.

**MentorAI:**

That’s a strong anchor. Lead with one specific moment and the rest snaps into focus—you’ll naturally stick to observable behavior and own your impact. Keep starting there and you’ll stay on target.
