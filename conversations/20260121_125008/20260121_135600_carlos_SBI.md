**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework, with success defined as a concrete moment, camera-testable behavior, and impact in owned language. I’ll demonstrate how I approach it first, then we’ll move into your practice. Ready to dive in?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yeah, go ahead. Let’s keep it quick.

**MentorAI:**

Quick model with my thinking: “In Tuesday’s standup when we shifted to blockers, you started speaking while Jenna was mid-sentence and later answered over Miguel as he began; I felt a jolt of stress and hesitated to share, and we ran out of time for my update.” I anchored to one meeting, described camera-visible actions instead of judgments like “dominated,” and owned my impact (stress and a missed update) rather than calling it “unprofessional.” If you were self-checking your own SBI, what would you look for to confirm it hits the mark?

**carlos_SBI:**

Specific moment, what they did, and the impact. If those are in there, it’s fine. Looks good to me. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Quick check: “In yesterday’s sprint review, you were disrespectful to the client; I felt it was unprofessional.” What’s the first thing you’d change to make this meet the bar?

**carlos_SBI:**

Drop the judgment words. Replace “disrespectful/unprofessional” with the specific behavior you saw. That’s the first fix. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Your turn: write one quick SBI from a real recent moment—name the meeting/time, describe camera-visible behavior, and say the impact on you in owned language. One or two sentences max. What’s your draft?

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in meetings, you were rude and dismissive; it made the meeting tense and awkward.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—keeping this brisk. Before I weigh in, what’s the first thing you think I’ll push back on in your sentence?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me. Maybe you’ll say it’s a bit vague, but it’s clear enough.

**MentorAI:**

Let’s keep it brisk: run the 3-point self-check on your draft—anchored moment, camera-visible behavior (no labels), and owned impact (what you felt or what happened to you). Which parts pass and which need revision?

**carlos_SBI:**

- Anchored moment: Pass.
- Behavior: Needs revision (swap “rude/dismissive” for what they did).
- Impact: Pass. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Nice catch on the behavior. One more to tighten: “it made the meeting tense and awkward” describes the room, not you—impact should be what you felt or what happened to you. What did you actually experience (e.g., “I felt…,” “I hesitated to share…,” “I checked out…”)? Give me that short phrase.

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine, but it’s basically the same: “I felt it was awkward.”

**MentorAI:**

Totally get the “this is nitpicky” vibe—this tweak trips lots of people up. To make it owned, drop “it was” and name your experience. What’s your exact impact line—e.g., “I felt awkward” or “I hesitated to share”?

**carlos_SBI:**

I felt awkward.

**MentorAI:**

Good—that’s owned impact. Now give me the full SBI in one or two sentences: pick one specific meeting, name exactly what they did that a camera would catch (not “rude/dismissive”), and finish with “I felt awkward” or your exact impact. What’s your draft?

**carlos_SBI:**

In last week’s team sync, during updates you kept interrupting while people were talking; I felt awkward.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, which part of your sentence feels least camera-visible?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me. If anything, “kept interrupting” maybe—but it’s clear enough. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

You’re right—it’s the “kept interrupting” bit; that’s a summary, not something a camera would catch. Pick one instance from that sync: who was mid-sentence, and what did you start saying as you came in? Replace that clause with that single example and give me the revised one-liner.

**carlos_SBI:**

In last week’s team sync, you started talking over Jenna while she was mid-sentence to give your update; I felt awkward.

**MentorAI:**

Why that moment for the situation—what made you pick that one?

**carlos_SBI:**

It was the one that came to mind. Same thing happens in meetings a lot, so that example works. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

That lands—meets the bar. Now a variation with higher stakes: it’s your manager. In Thursday’s client QBR, while the client was laying out their priorities, your manager started speaking over them to defend your team’s approach. Give me your SBI to your manager in one or two sentences.

**carlos_SBI:**

In last week’s client QBR, you were defensive and talked over the client while they laid out priorities; it was awkward and created tension.

**MentorAI:**

Anchored moment lands. Impact isn’t owned—“it was awkward and created tension” describes the room; name what you felt or what happened to you. Revise with an owned impact and resend your one-liner.

**carlos_SBI:**

In last week’s client QBR, you were defensive and talked over the client while they laid out priorities; I felt awkward.

**MentorAI:**

Anchor lands, impact is owned. The behavior still carries judgment—“defensive” isn’t camera-visible; swap it for what you literally saw/heard. Revise the one-liner and resend.

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine, I’ll drop “defensive.” In last week’s client QBR, you talked over the client while they laid out priorities; I felt awkward.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar—clear moment, camera-visible behavior, and owned impact. Clean and direct 👍. What changed in your thinking from the first to this version that you’ll carry forward?

**carlos_SBI:**

Nothing major. Just drop the labels, pick one concrete example, and state “I felt X.” Same thing I do—just tighter. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Takeaway: when you catch yourself using a label or describing the room, swap it for one anchored moment, the camera-visible action, and your own felt impact—those three keep you tight and fair.

**carlos_SBI:**

Got it. I can do that. Are we done?

**MentorAI:**

Yep, we’re done—you hit the goal with two clean SBIs. Anything else on SBI before we close?

**carlos_SBI:**

No, I’m good. Looks straightforward.

**MentorAI:**

All set—keep using the quick filter: one moment, camera-visible action, owned impact. See you next time.

**carlos_SBI:**

Works for me. See you.

**MentorAI:**

See you next time—nice work today.

**carlos_SBI:**

Yep. Later.

**MentorAI:**

Later—talk soon.
