**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework, aiming for two full attempts that nail a real moment, observable behavior, and owned impact. I’ll demonstrate first so you can see how I think it through, then we’ll shift to your practice. Ready to start?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yeah. Let’s keep it quick.

**MentorAI:**

Great—here’s a quick demo so you can see it in action. In Monday’s sprint planning, after I asked about QA coverage, you said “let’s not get into that” and clicked to the next story on the board. I felt frustrated and hesitant to raise blockers after that, and I spent about 30 minutes post‑meeting rechecking my plan. I’m anchoring to one clear moment, using a quote plus an observable action (not a label), and owning my impact (feeling + direct consequence). My snap self-check: real moment, camera‑test behavior, owned impact. What did you notice?

**carlos_SBI:**

You picked a specific moment, used a quote, and said how it hit you and your time. Looks fine. Ready to do mine?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—give me your full SBI draft about a real moment with a colleague: name the specific meeting/interaction, describe what you saw or heard (no labels), and say how it affected you (feeling or direct consequence). Keep it to 2–3 sentences and drop it here.

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in meetings with Jordan. He was rude and dismissive. It was awkward and created problems for the team.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back against the criteria—real moment, camera‑test behavior, or owned impact?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me. I hit all three.

**MentorAI:**

Quick tighten: “Last week in meetings with Jordan” isn’t a single moment. What specific interaction are you anchoring to—e.g., Tuesday’s standup, the client call on Thursday, or your 1:1 on Friday?

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine—Tuesday’s standup. Same thing.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—keeping it tight. In Tuesday’s standup, what did you actually see or hear from Jordan—one or two concrete things a camera would catch (exact words, interruptions, actions)?

**carlos_SBI:**

He was dismissive—kept shutting me down. Pretty rude.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like pinning this down is irritating—totally normal at this step. In that standup, what’s one thing a camera would catch: the exact words he said to you, word‑for‑word, or a specific action like interrupting before you finished?

**carlos_SBI:**

He cut me off mid-sentence and said, “We don’t have time for this.”

**MentorAI:**

Good—that’s concrete. Now put it together: write 2–3 sentences starting with “In Tuesday’s standup…”, include the interruption and the exact words, and end with how it affected you (your feeling and/or a direct consequence you experienced). Your full draft?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, Jordan cut me off mid-sentence and said, “We don’t have time for this.” It was rude and made the meeting awkward and caused problems for the team.

**MentorAI:**

Before I give notes, where do you think this might leak judgment or miss owned impact—if anywhere?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine. Maybe “rude” if we’re nitpicking, but the impact’s fine. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

What was the direct impact on you—name one feeling or consequence you experienced right after he cut you off (e.g., “I felt …” or “I held back on …”)?

**carlos_SBI:**

It was frustrating and made the meeting tense.

**MentorAI:**

Quick tweak: switch to owned impact—“I felt frustrated”—and replace “made the meeting tense” with one concrete consequence you experienced (for example, “I held back on raising the dependency”). Try that and share your two-sentence draft.

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, Jordan cut me off mid-sentence and said, “We don’t have time for this,” which was rude. I felt frustrated and held back a bit.

**MentorAI:**

You’ve kept this tight—we’re close. What were you aiming to convey by adding “which was rude” after the quote—why include that label?

**carlos_SBI:**

Just calling it like it was—being direct. Felt important not to soften it.

**MentorAI:**

Makes sense to want to be direct—you don’t need to soften. The cleaner way to stay direct is to let the concrete behavior plus your impact do the work; labels like “rude” add heat and invite debate. Drop “which was rude” and keep the interruption + quote. Share your two‑sentence draft with that label removed.

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, Jordan cut me off mid-sentence and said, “We don’t have time for this.” I felt frustrated and held back a bit.

**MentorAI:**

This lands—your moment and behavior are crisp. One tighten on impact: “held back a bit” is vague; name exactly what you held back on (e.g., the dependency, a risk, a question) so it’s a concrete consequence. Update the second sentence with that specific thing and share the two‑sentence draft.

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, Jordan cut me off mid-sentence and said, “We don’t have time for this.” I felt frustrated and held back on a dependency.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar—clear moment, camera‑test behavior, and owned impact. For your second rep, here’s a variation: on Thursday’s client status call with Acme, your manager Priya cut you off two sentences into your risk update with “Let’s move on” and switched to the budget while the client was on the line. Write your 2–3 sentence feedback using the same criteria—real moment, observable behavior, owned impact—and drop it here.

**carlos_SBI:**

On the client call with Acme, Priya was dismissive and cut me off to jump to budget. It was unprofessional and made the call awkward for everyone.

**MentorAI:**

Your moment is identifiable. The gap is impact: “unprofessional” and “made the call awkward for everyone” aren’t owned—say how it hit you specifically (a feeling and/or a concrete consequence you experienced). Revise your 2–3 sentence draft with an owned impact and drop it back in.

**carlos_SBI:**

On the client call with Acme, Priya cut me off, said “Let’s move on,” and jumped to budget. I felt annoyed, and it made the call awkward for everyone.

**MentorAI:**

Moment and behavior are solid—the interruption, the quote, and the switch to budget are camera‑testable. The gap is impact: “made the call awkward for everyone” isn’t owned. Revise so the impact is only yours—keep “I felt annoyed” and add a specific consequence you experienced, or just stop after the feeling. Drop your 2–3 sentence revision here.

**carlos_SBI:**

On Thursday’s client status call with Acme, Priya cut me off two sentences into my risk update, said “Let’s move on,” and switched to budget while the client was on the line. I felt annoyed.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar—specific moment, camera-test behavior, and owned impact. What principle from this will you carry forward the next time you give SBI feedback?

**carlos_SBI:**

Pick one moment, say exactly what was said/done, and state how it hit me. Keep it short.

**MentorAI:**

That’s the principle—keep using the “camera + I” test: one real moment, what the camera would capture, and your owned impact (“I felt… / so I…”), no labels needed. That will keep your feedback crisp and hard to argue with. 👍

**carlos_SBI:**

Got it. I’ll use the camera + I test.

**MentorAI:**

Perfect—that’s the move. All set to wrap here, or anything else you want to tweak before we close?

**carlos_SBI:**

All set. We can wrap.

**MentorAI:**

Takeaway: when you feel the urge to label, pause and ask “What did the camera see, and how did it land on me?”—that keeps you direct without extra heat. Thanks for the focused work today 👋
