**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success looks like naming a real moment, describing only observable behavior, using owned impact language, and spotting when judgment creeps in. I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll switch to your turn—ready to begin?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yeah, go ahead. Ready.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s a quick modeled example, with my thinking made visible:
- In Tuesday’s standup, when updates started at 9:05.
- You spoke for about 10 minutes and walked through specific test-case steps after the facilitator asked for a high‑level update.
- I felt anxious and ended up skipping one of my items when we ran over by five minutes.
- Notice I picked a recognizable moment, kept behavior camera-testable (length and content), and used owned impact (“I felt anxious,” “I skipped an item”) instead of a verdict like “that was unprofessional.”
- Watch-out: it’s tempting to say “you rambled”—I stripped that judgment and named what I could see/hear instead.

I’ll pause there—take a beat, then say when you’re ready to try your own.

**carlos_SBI:**

Okay. Ready to try mine.

**MentorAI:**

Before you draft, what’s your 10‑second self-check to catch judgment creeping into the behavior line and keep the impact in “I felt/I experienced” language?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me—avoid loaded words, and for impact I’ll just start with “I felt.” Done.

**MentorAI:**

Good start. Here’s a tighter self-check to run in 10 seconds:
- Moment: Can I name the meeting and when in it this happened?
- Behavior: Would a camera/mic catch this exactly (quotes, counts, actions)—no labels or mind‑reading?
- Impact: Does it start with “I felt…” or “I ended up…” and name my emotion or direct consequence (not “I felt like/that you…”)?

Use that, then draft your full SBI in one go.

**carlos_SBI:**

- Situation: Last week, in meetings.
- Behavior: You were rude and dismissive—you rambled and ignored the agenda.
- Impact: It was awkward and created problems; the meeting ran long and people got confused.

**MentorAI:**

If I were to push back on one part of your draft first, which line do you think I’d target, and why?

**carlos_SBI:**

Probably the behavior line—because I said “rude/dismissive.” But it reads fine to me.

**MentorAI:**

Run the 10‑second self-check on each line—what passes and what fails, and why?

**carlos_SBI:**

- Situation: Pass. “Last week, in meetings” is clear enough.
- Behavior: Mostly pass. Yeah, “rude/dismissive” are labels, but that’s what happened.
- Impact: Pass. It states the effect—awkward, ran long, people confused.

**MentorAI:**

Can you anchor the situation to a single recognizable moment—name the specific meeting and when in it this happened?

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week’s standup, early on.

**MentorAI:**

“Last week’s standup, early on” works. For the behavior, strip out “rude/dismissive” and name only what a mic/camera would catch—exact words, interruptions, counts, timing, or actions against the agenda. Draft one behavior sentence from that moment using only what someone could hear/see.

**carlos_SBI:**

You kept interrupting and rambling, ignoring the agenda after being asked for a high‑level update.

**MentorAI:**

Which words in your line are labels a camera wouldn’t capture, and can you rewrite the sentence by replacing them with things you could count, quote, or time from that moment?

**carlos_SBI:**

Labels: “interrupting,” “rambling,” and “ignoring the agenda.”

Rewrite: You cut me off a couple times and talked through test‑case steps for a while after the facilitator asked for a high‑level update.

**MentorAI:**

Nice—labels are gone. Tighten the behavior by swapping “a couple times” for an exact count and “for a while” for an estimate in minutes so it’s camera‑testable. Rewrite that one sentence with those specifics and share it.

**carlos_SBI:**

You cut me off twice and talked through test‑case steps for about 9 minutes after the facilitator asked for a high‑level update.

**MentorAI:**

That behavior line is camera‑testable—nice. Put it all together now: in one go, write your full feedback with that specific moment, your behavior sentence, and an impact line that starts with “I felt…” or “I ended up…” naming your emotion or a direct consequence for you (not about others). Go ahead.

**carlos_SBI:**

- Situation: Last week’s standup, early on.
- Behavior: You cut me off twice and talked through test‑case steps for about 9 minutes after the facilitator asked for a high‑level update.
- Impact: I felt it was awkward and it created problems—I ended up rushing my update and the meeting ran long.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, if I push back anywhere, what in your impact line might not meet the owned‑impact rule—and why?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me. If anything, “created problems” might not be strictly “I” language, but it’s accurate.

**MentorAI:**

Zoom in on your feeling. Replace “I felt it was awkward” with “I felt [specific emotion]” that fits that moment (e.g., anxious, embarrassed, pressured). Rewrite your impact line with that change and share it.

**carlos_SBI:**

I felt pressured, and I ended up rushing my update; the meeting ran long.

**MentorAI:**

This is close. The first two pieces of your impact are owned; “the meeting ran long” drifts to a general outcome. Swap that for a direct consequence you experienced in that moment—what did you cut, skip, or change because of the overrun? Update just the impact line and share it.

**carlos_SBI:**

I felt pressured, and I ended up rushing and skipping some details in my update.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—clear moment, camera‑testable behavior, owned impact 👍. Now for a variation: after last Thursday’s client QBR with Acme, you want to give feedback to Jordan (PM from a partner team); during your update, right after the chair asked for one‑minute, high‑level updates, Jordan jumped in and walked through detailed backlog items in a time‑boxed meeting. Draft your full SBI to Jordan in one go.

**carlos_SBI:**

- Situation: Last Thursday’s client QBR with Acme.
- Behavior: You hijacked my update, rambling through backlog minutiae and ignoring the one‑minute ask.
- Impact: It was awkward and threw the meeting off; we ran over and people got confused.

**MentorAI:**

The situation is anchored to a real moment—good. The behavior line leans on judgment (“hijacked,” “rambling,” “ignoring”) instead of camera‑testable actions, and the impact isn’t owned (“It was awkward…,” “we ran over,” “people got confused”). Revise the full SBI: keep the situation, rewrite the behavior with what someone could count/quote/time, and make the impact start with “I felt…” or “I ended up…” naming your emotion and a direct consequence for you. Share your revised draft in one go.

**carlos_SBI:**

- Situation: Last Thursday’s client QBR with Acme, during my update right after the chair asked for one‑minute, high‑level updates.
- Behavior: You took over my update by jumping in while I was one sentence in and walked through three backlog items (ABC‑123, ABC‑129, ABC‑141) for about 4 minutes after the one‑minute ask.
- Impact: I felt pressured and ended up skipping my risks note to keep the time, and the meeting ran long.

**MentorAI:**

Strong anchor and solid specifics on counts/timing. Two fixes: drop the judgment “took over my update” and make the interruption camera‑testable, and remove the non‑owned “the meeting ran long” (stick to your consequence). Revise and share your full SBI in one go.

**carlos_SBI:**

- Situation: Last Thursday’s client QBR with Acme, during my update right after the chair asked for one‑minute, high‑level updates.
- Behavior: You cut in while I was mid‑sentence and walked through three backlog items (ABC‑123, ABC‑129, ABC‑141) for about 4 minutes after the one‑minute ask.
- Impact: I felt pressured and ended up skipping my risks note to keep the time, and people seemed confused.

**MentorAI:**

Almost—one thing to tighten 🔧. The situation is specific and the behavior is camera‑testable—nice. In the impact, “people seemed confused” isn’t owned; it shifts to others and speculation. Cut that or replace it with a direct consequence you experienced in the moment, then share your revised full SBI.

**carlos_SBI:**

- Situation: Last Thursday’s client QBR with Acme, during my update right after the chair asked for one‑minute, high‑level updates.
- Behavior: You cut in while I was mid‑sentence and walked through three backlog items (ABC‑123, ABC‑129, ABC‑141) for about 4 minutes after the one‑minute ask.
- Impact: I felt pressured and ended up skipping my risks note to keep the time.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—meets the bar on all three pieces. What principle will you carry forward next time to keep the behavior judgment‑free and the impact in “I” language?

**carlos_SBI:**

Camera-test the behavior; start the impact with “I felt/I ended up.”

**MentorAI:**

Lock this in: if a camera or mic wouldn’t capture the behavior exactly, it doesn’t go in; if the impact doesn’t start with “I felt/I ended up…,” rewrite it until it does. That single cue will keep your feedback specific, fair, and easy to act on.

**carlos_SBI:**

Got it. Sounds fine. Are we done?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—you met the goal. Your two drafts hit the criteria, and you’ve got the “camera-test behavior, start impact with I felt/I ended up” cue locked in. Anything else on SBI you want to clarify before we wrap?
