**MentorAI:**

We’re focusing on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means anchoring to a specific moment, describing only observable behavior, and owning the impact in your words—and being able to catch when judgment sneaks into the behavior. I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll switch to your turn; ready to dive in?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yeah, go ahead. Let’s keep it quick.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—here’s a quick demo. Scenario: Tuesday’s standup, we’re on blockers. “In Tuesday’s standup, when we were sharing blockers, you spoke over Priya twice and shifted us to the hiring update. I felt rushed and worried we’d miss her dependency, and I spent time after the meeting catching up to understand her blocker.” I’m anchoring to one moment, keeping the behavior camera-visible (no labels like “dominating”), and owning the impact as my feeling and concrete consequence—watch-outs are words like “unprofessional,” “always,” or mind-reading. Ready to try your own SBI in one short go?

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in meetings, you were rude and dismissive and kept hijacking the conversation. It was awkward and created problems.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you predict I’ll push back against the criteria—moment, camera‑visible behavior, or owned impact?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you want to keep this tight—fair. To meet the bar, we need a single recognizable moment, not “last week in meetings.” Which exact meeting and point in it are you referring to?

**carlos_SBI:**

It was our standup last week, during blockers. Same thing.

**MentorAI:**

Good—that pins the moment. In that standup, what would a camera/mic have captured—specific words or actions—instead of labels like “rude” or “hijacking”?

**carlos_SBI:**

You cut me off and shifted to the hiring update. Same thing.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—you’re keeping this tight, and that behavior is camera‑visible. Now put the impact in your words: what did you feel in the moment, or what did you have to do because of it?

**carlos_SBI:**

It was awkward and derailed the discussion. Caused extra work afterward.

**MentorAI:**

You’re close—right now “awkward” and “derailed” sit outside your experience. Put it in owned terms: “I felt X” and “I had to Y”—what are X and Y for you?

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine—I felt rushed, and I had to follow up after the meeting to sort it out. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Heard—keeping it brisk. Before we move on, one quick line: why choose that standup moment—what made that the right anchor for you?

**carlos_SBI:**

Because it stood out—most obvious and recent. That’s it. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar 👍. Second round, higher stakes: in yesterday’s roadmap review with the VP, while you were walking through Q2 risks, Jordan from Marketing started talking over you and moved the room to the launch plan. Give Jordan your SBI in one short go—full draft, all three pieces together.

**carlos_SBI:**

In yesterday’s meeting, you were dismissive and hijacked the conversation to your launch plan. It was awkward and created problems after.

**MentorAI:**

Direct feedback: the behavior relies on judgments (“dismissive,” “hijacked”) instead of observable actions. Swap those for what a camera/mic would catch—specific words or actions in that VP review moment. Give me a revised full SBI for Jordan.

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine—same thing. In yesterday’s roadmap review during the Q2 risks section, you cut me off twice and said, “Let’s move to the launch plan.” It derailed the discussion and created extra cleanup afterward.

**MentorAI:**

Moment is specific and the behavior is camera‑visible—that lands. The impact isn’t owned here: “derailed” and “created extra cleanup” judge the meeting rather than naming your feeling and what you personally had to do. Replace that with your actual emotion in the moment and the concrete follow‑up you did. Give me a revised one‑liner for Jordan with those changes.

**carlos_SBI:**

In yesterday’s roadmap review during the Q2 risks section, you cut me off twice and said, “Let’s move to the launch plan”; I felt rushed and I had to send a quick recap afterward to cover the risks you skipped. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

That lands—clear moment, camera‑visible behavior, and owned impact. One micro‑tweak: drop “you skipped” and say “that we didn’t cover” to keep the impact fully owned. What’s one phrasing principle you’ll carry forward from this?

**carlos_SBI:**

Keep the behavior camera‑visible—actions/words, not labels. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Nice—hold onto this: own the impact with “I felt…” plus one concrete “I had to…,” and you’ll stay grounded and non‑judgmental. You’re set.

**carlos_SBI:**

Okay. I’m good.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—you’re set 👍

**carlos_SBI:**

Yep, all set.

**MentorAI:**

All set—nice work.

**carlos_SBI:**

All good.

**MentorAI:**

All right—I'll leave it there. Anything else on SBI before we wrap?

**carlos_SBI:**

Nope, I’m good.

**MentorAI:**

All right—let’s wrap here. You’ve got it, and I’m here if you want to tune tone or handle trickier dynamics next time.

**carlos_SBI:**

Sounds good. Done here.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—closing here. Ping me anytime you want to tune an SBI for a tougher situation.

**carlos_SBI:**

Sure. Will do.

**MentorAI:**

Anytime 👍

**carlos_SBI:**

Cool.

**MentorAI:**

All right—closing here. If you want to workshop a tricky SBI later, just ping me.

**carlos_SBI:**

Okay.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—closing here.
