**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework in a professional context. Success looks like you doing two full attempts that hit the bar: a specific moment, observable behavior, and owned impact; I’ll model briefly first, then you’ll try. Ready for a quick demo?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yeah, go ahead. Keep it quick.

**MentorAI:**

Quick demo—watch the shape I use:

1) Anchor to a real moment: “In Tuesday’s standup when we reviewed sprint 14 risks…” (I’m avoiding vague “lately” so the other person can picture it.)  
2) Name only what a camera would catch: “…you jumped in twice while I was explaining the deployment plan.” (I’m choosing “jumped in twice” over “kept interrupting” to keep it observable.)  
3) Own the impact: “I lost my train of thought and felt flustered, and we ran over time so I skipped the testing risk.” (I’m naming my emotion and a concrete consequence I experienced.)  
4) Quick judgment scrub: if I hear words like “unprofessional” or “disrespectful,” I rewrite them into either behavior or my felt impact.

Pause there—ready to work with your own situation?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yeah. Let’s do it—quickly.

**MentorAI:**

Your turn: write 2–3 sentences to a peer about a real moment you experienced—name the specific moment, describe only what a camera would’ve caught, and own your impact (what you felt or what directly happened to you). Send the full draft in one go.

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in meetings, you were dismissive and unprofessional. It was awkward and created problems for the team.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back most here—the moment, the behavior, or the impact—and why?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me. If anything, maybe the behavior—but it’s basically the same thing.

**MentorAI:**

Do a quick three‑point self‑check on your draft—1) is the moment a single, recallable instance, 2) would a camera catch the behavior words, and 3) is the impact owned (your feeling or a direct consequence to you). Which part fails your check, and why?

**carlos_SBI:**

All three look fine to me. If anything, the moment could be tighter, but “last week in meetings” is clear enough. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

We can keep it tight. Let’s fix one thing first: “dismissive and unprofessional” is a judgment—what did the camera see or hear? Rewrite your two sentences, changing only that phrase to concrete actions (e.g., “you spoke over me twice”); keep the rest the same for now. Your turn.

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in meetings, you cut me off and rolled your eyes. It was awkward and created problems for the team.

**MentorAI:**

Nice—your behavior is now camera‑ready. Next fix: the moment is too broad. Pick one specific meeting (e.g., “in Tuesday’s standup”) and replace “Last week in meetings” with that—keep everything else the same. Share the updated two sentences.

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, you cut me off and rolled your eyes. It was awkward and created problems for the team.

**MentorAI:**

Good—last fix: the impact isn’t owned. Replace “It was awkward and created problems for the team” with what you personally felt or a direct consequence to you (e.g., “I felt flustered and lost my train of thought”). Keep the first sentence as is and rewrite the second—your turn.

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, you cut me off and rolled your eyes. I felt annoyed and it made the meeting awkward—can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Heard—you're close and want to move fast. Quick check before we lock it: you chose “annoyed”—why that word over, say, “flustered” or “awkward”? What were you trying to capture with that choice?

**carlos_SBI:**

Because it was irritating—you cut me off. I wasn’t flustered; I just found it rude.

**MentorAI:**

Makes sense—you’re naming irritation, not confusion. To hit the bar, drop “and it made the meeting awkward”—that part isn’t owned; end the second sentence after “I felt annoyed.” Share your final two sentences.

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, you rudely cut me off and rolled your eyes. I felt annoyed.

**MentorAI:**

Almost there—one word to scrub: “rudely” is a judgment sneaking back in. Drop it so the behavior stays camera‑ready, then share your final two sentences.

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, you cut me off and rolled your eyes. I felt annoyed, and it was awkward. Good now?

**MentorAI:**

Close—how will you turn “and it was awkward” into owned impact (rewrite it as your feeling or drop it) and give me your final two-sentence version?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, you cut me off and rolled your eyes. I felt annoyed. Done?

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar 👍. Second round, higher stakes: during Thursday’s Zoom client kickoff, while I was outlining the timeline, you typed “this seems overkill” in the public chat and then started talking over me to propose a simpler plan. Give me your 2–3 sentence feedback to them using that moment, the observable behavior, and your owned impact—full draft in one go.

**carlos_SBI:**

On the client kickoff call, you were disrespectful—typing “this seems overkill” in the public chat and then hijacking the discussion. It derailed the meeting and confused the client.

**MentorAI:**

Anchor is fine. The impact line misses the bar—it isn’t owned; rewrite it to name what you felt or a direct consequence to you. Give me the revised 2–3 sentences.

**carlos_SBI:**

On the client kickoff call, you were disrespectful—typing “this seems overkill” in the public chat and then hijacking the discussion. I felt irritated and lost my place.

**MentorAI:**

Anchor and impact land. The behavior line isn’t camera‑ready—“disrespectful” and “hijacking” are judgments; stick to what was seen/heard (posting “this seems overkill” in public chat and talking over me to propose a simpler plan). Revise and send your final 2–3 sentences.

**carlos_SBI:**

On the client kickoff call, you posted “this seems overkill” in the public chat and talked over me to propose a simpler plan. I felt irritated and lost my place. That it?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—that meets the bar. Quick reflection: under time pressure, what’s the one principle you’ll carry forward to keep behavior observable and the impact owned?

**carlos_SBI:**

Say what a camera would see, and own it with “I felt …”.

**MentorAI:**

That’s the core: camera sees it, I feel it. When a judgment word pops up (“rude,” “unprofessional”), convert it into either what was seen/heard or how it landed on you—keep doing that and your SBI will land cleanly. You’re set 👍

**carlos_SBI:**

Got it. I’m good.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—you’re set. Keep using “camera sees it, I feel it,” and your feedback will stay clean.

**carlos_SBI:**

Yep. I’m set.

**MentorAI:**

All set—keep “camera sees it, I feel it” as your guide.

**carlos_SBI:**

Got it.

**MentorAI:**

Great—you’re set. If you want to stress‑test it later, bring a tougher scenario and we’ll sharpen it.

**carlos_SBI:**

I’m good. If I need it, I’ll bring one.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—I’ll leave it here. Ping me when you want to run another scenario?
