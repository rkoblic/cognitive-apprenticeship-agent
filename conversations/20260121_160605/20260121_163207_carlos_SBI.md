**MentorAI:**

We’ll work on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means naming a specific moment, describing camera-testable behavior, owning the impact on you, and spotting where judgment creeps in. I’ll demonstrate how I do it, then we’ll practice—ready to start?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yeah, go ahead. Let’s keep it quick.

**MentorAI:**

Quick model, then your turn. In Tuesday’s standup while I was giving the API update, you started talking twice before I finished; I lost my thread, felt flustered, and we ran out of time to surface blockers. Notice I anchored to a single moment, described what a camera would catch (“started talking twice before I finished”), and owned the impact (“I lost my thread, felt flustered…”), avoiding judgments like “rude.” Quick self-check you’ll reuse: one real moment, camera-test behavior, owned impact, scrub judgment words. Ready to try one from your own work context?

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week. In meetings.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—let’s pin it to one moment. Pick one specific meeting last week (name it) and draft your full SBI for that moment in 1–2 sentences—can you do that now?

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in a team meeting, you were rude and dismissive and kept derailing the conversation; it was awkward and created problems. That’s it.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, predict where I’ll push back: the moment, the behavior, or the impact—what feels shakiest in your draft, and why?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me. If anything, the moment—since I just said last week. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Got it—let’s tighten one piece fast. When you wrote “rude and dismissive,” what did you actually see or hear in that meeting—a camera-test action like “you interrupted me twice mid-sentence” or “you rolled your eyes when I proposed X”? Give me that one observable behavior so we can slot it in. What was it?

**carlos_SBI:**

You interrupted me while I was talking. Same thing.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you want to keep this tight—that’s fine, and this part can feel nitpicky. Let’s lock the moment: which exact meeting last week are you referring to—name it (e.g., Tuesday standup, client demo, 1:1)?

**carlos_SBI:**

The standup last week. One of them.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like naming the exact standup feels tedious—this is the last tighten to make it land. Which day was it—Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.—so we can lock the moment?

**carlos_SBI:**

Midweek—one of the standups. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like nailing the exact day feels tedious—fair; we just need a recognizable anchor. Let’s call it Wednesday’s standup so we can move on: in 1–2 sentences, write your SBI using that moment, the camera-test behavior you named (“you interrupted me while I was talking”—add a count if you remember), and one owned impact (how you felt or what happened for you). Can you draft that now?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Wednesday’s standup, you interrupted me while I was talking a couple times and were pretty dismissive; it was awkward and threw the meeting off.

**MentorAI:**

You’re keeping it tight—let’s keep it tight. If I push on one thing, which is it—the behavior line or the impact line—and why?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me. If anything, the impact—since I just said it was awkward. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Heard—let’s keep it tight. Run the quick 4-point self-check on your sentence (one real moment, camera-test behavior, owned impact, scrub judgment words): what, if anything, would you change—especially on the impact line?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine. If anything, I’d change the impact to “it made the meeting tense and we ran out of time.” Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

You want to move fast—cool. One tighten so it lands: “pretty dismissive” is a judgment, not camera-test; swap it for what you saw/heard (e.g., an eye roll, a sigh, a specific phrase) or drop it. Can you revise your sentence with just that change?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Wednesday’s standup, you interrupted me while I was talking a couple times; it made the meeting tense and we ran out of time. Done?

**MentorAI:**

Close—moment and behavior are solid. One tighten to meet the bar: “made the meeting tense” describes the room, not your internal state; own it with how you felt or what happened for you (you can keep “we ran out of time”). Can you swap in an owned feeling and post the single sentence?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Wednesday’s standup, you interrupted me while I was talking a couple times; I felt annoyed, it was awkward, and we ran out of time. Done?

**MentorAI:**

Almost there. Make one tweak: change “it was awkward” to “I felt awkward” (or just drop that phrase) so the impact is fully owned. Share the updated one-liner.

**carlos_SBI:**

In Wednesday’s standup, you interrupted me while I was talking a couple times; I felt annoyed and awkward, and we ran out of time. Done?

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar 👍. Second rep, higher stakes: imagine you’re giving a client demo and your manager jumps in and speaks over you twice during Q&A. Draft your 1–2 sentence feedback you’d deliver to your manager using the same SBI approach—post the full attempt.

**carlos_SBI:**

In the client demo, you were dismissive and spoke over me twice during Q&A and basically took over; it was awkward and confused the client.

**MentorAI:**

Moment’s fine. One miss: “dismissive” and “basically took over” are judgments, not camera-test. Keep “spoke over me twice during Q&A” and drop/replace the judgment phrases with what a camera would catch, then post your revised 1–2 sentences.

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine. In the client demo, during Q&A you spoke over me twice; it was awkward and confused the client. Done?

**MentorAI:**

You’re moving fast—appreciate the quick revision. One gap: the impact isn’t owned—“it was awkward” describes the room, and “confused the client” isn’t your internal state or a direct consequence for you. Swap in how you felt or what happened for you, then repost your 1–2 sentences.

**carlos_SBI:**

In the client demo during Q&A, you spoke over me twice; I felt frustrated and lost my train of thought. Done?

**MentorAI:**

That lands—anchored moment, camera-test behavior, owned impact 👍. What felt different on this one compared to your first attempt—what clicked or what still felt annoying?

**carlos_SBI:**

Not much different—I just said it tighter. The exact-moment and “I felt” stuff still feels nitpicky. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Totally get that it feels nitpicky—that precision is what keeps feedback from turning into a debate and makes it land: one real moment, one camera-visible action, one “I felt…” or direct consequence. Keep that “one-one-one” rule in your pocket for higher‑stakes conversations—that’s the lever you pulled cleanly on your second draft.

**carlos_SBI:**

Yeah, one-one-one. Got it. Are we done?

**MentorAI:**

One beat before we wrap: what’s the single thing you’ll carry forward—one moment, camera‑test behavior, or owned impact?

**carlos_SBI:**

One real moment. Can we wrap?

**MentorAI:**

Takeaway: lead with one real moment—anchor that first, and the camera-test behavior and owned impact fall into place. That’s the shift you made between drafts; keep that “moment first” habit 👍.

**carlos_SBI:**

Got it—moment first. All set?

**MentorAI:**

All set—you met the bar. Nice work; “moment first” will carry you 👍.
