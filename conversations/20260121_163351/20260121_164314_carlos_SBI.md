**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI. Success means you anchor to a specific moment, describe only observable behavior, and own your impact clearly. I’ll demonstrate first, then you’ll try—ready to dive in?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yeah, go ahead—let’s keep it quick.

**MentorAI:**

Quick model, as promised:

“In Tuesday’s standup while I was sharing the testing update, you started talking while I was mid-sentence twice. I lost my train of thought and felt flustered, and we moved on without the testing risk I was flagging.”

Why this works: it’s anchored to a real moment, the behavior is camera-testable (speaking over me twice), and the impact is my inner state plus a direct consequence. I deliberately avoided judgment words like “rude” or “unprofessional”—that’s where bias creeps in. Ready to continue?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yep, got it. Same idea I already use—let’s move on.

**MentorAI:**

Quick check: What’s the first thing you’d change, if anything, to make this meet SBI—“In Monday’s planning meeting, you said ‘those estimates are unrealistic’ and sighed while I was speaking. I felt it was unprofessional.”?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me. I wouldn’t change anything.

**MentorAI:**

Can you rewrite just the last sentence so it names your own emotion or a direct consequence you experienced, rather than a judgment about professionalism?

**carlos_SBI:**

It was awkward.

**MentorAI:**

Can you put that in “I” language—either the emotion you felt or a direct consequence you experienced?

**carlos_SBI:**

I felt annoyed.

**MentorAI:**

Good—that’s owned impact. Your turn now: draft a full SBI for a real recent moment you want to address—name the specific moment, describe only what was observable, and state your own impact—in 2–3 sentences. What’s your draft?

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in our meetings, you were unprofessional and dismissive. You kept derailing things. It was awkward and created problems.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, which part do you think I’ll ask you to tighten to meet SBI—moment, behavior, or impact?

**carlos_SBI:**

Looks fine to me.

**MentorAI:**

Run this quick 3-point SBI self-check on your draft: 1) is the moment a single recognizable instance (e.g., “Tuesday’s standup,” not “last week in our meetings”)? 2) are the behaviors camera-testable (no labels like “unprofessional” or “dismissive”—what did they say/do)? 3) does the impact name your emotion or a direct consequence you experienced? What passes and what needs work?

**carlos_SBI:**

All three pass. Looks fine.

**MentorAI:**

Okay—let’s zero in on the moment. When you say “last week in our meetings,” which single meeting are you anchoring to—name the one moment you want them to picture?

**carlos_SBI:**

The standup earlier this week.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—the standup earlier this week works as the moment. In that standup, what exactly did they do or say that a camera would capture—something specific instead of “unprofessional” or “dismissive”?

**carlos_SBI:**

They were dismissive—kept derailing and interrupting.

**MentorAI:**

“Dismissive” and “derailing” are labels—let’s pin one observable. What’s one exact sentence they said when they cut in during that standup?

**carlos_SBI:**

You said, “Can we move on? This isn’t important.”

**MentorAI:**

That’s specific—use it. Draft 2–3 sentences that anchor to “in the standup earlier this week,” name the behavior with that exact quote, and state your own impact (emotion or direct consequence). What’s your draft?

**carlos_SBI:**

In the standup earlier this week, while I was speaking, you cut in and said, “Can we move on? This isn’t important.” It was awkward and we moved on without the details.

**MentorAI:**

Almost there—the moment and behavior land. One tweak: make the impact owned—swap “It was awkward” for “I felt [emotion]” and tie the consequence to your experience (e.g., “I didn’t get to share the details on X”). Can you revise that last sentence?

**carlos_SBI:**

I felt annoyed, and we moved on without the details.

**MentorAI:**

Walk me through your choice to use the exact quote in the behavior—what were you aiming to capture with that phrasing?

**carlos_SBI:**

You wanted something specific, so I used the exact words. It shows the interruption, that’s all. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

That lands—meets the bar 👍. Let’s up the stakes: in Wednesday’s client QBR on Zoom, while you were answering a risk question, your director cut in with “Let’s move on” and advanced to the next slide. Draft 2–3 sentences of SBI feedback you’d give your director—anchor to that moment, describe the observable behavior, and own your impact. What’s your draft?

**carlos_SBI:**

In the client QBR this week, you were dismissive and shut me down while I was answering the risk question. It was awkward and created problems.

**MentorAI:**

Not there yet. The behavior is labeled—“dismissive” and “shut me down” aren’t camera-testable. Replace that with what we could see/hear in that QBR (the specific words and action that happened). Give me a revised 2–3 sentence draft using observable behavior.

**carlos_SBI:**

In the QBR this week, while I was answering the risk question, you said, “Let’s move on,” and advanced to the next slide. It was awkward and we moved on without the details.

**MentorAI:**

Moment and behavior land. The impact misses the bar—“It was awkward” isn’t owned, and “we moved on…” isn’t in “I” terms. Rewrite the impact to name your emotion and the direct consequence you experienced (e.g., “I felt [emotion], and I didn’t get to…”). Send the revised 2–3 sentence draft.

**carlos_SBI:**

In the QBR this week, while I was answering the risk question, you said, “Let’s move on,” and advanced to the next slide. I felt frustrated, and I didn’t get to finish my answer.

**MentorAI:**

Looking back at this version, what changed in how you described the behavior so it stayed camera-testable?

**carlos_SBI:**

I used the exact words and the visible action—“Let’s move on” and advancing the slide—instead of labels. That keeps it camera-testable. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Nice—this meets the bar. What’s one principle you’ll carry forward to keep your SBI tight under pressure?

**carlos_SBI:**

Use exact words instead of labels. That’s it.

**MentorAI:**

Lock that in: under pressure, anchor to one moment and quote the exact words or visible action, then name your own emotion or consequence. That combo keeps judgment out and makes your feedback land.

**carlos_SBI:**

Got it.

**MentorAI:**

You’re set. Anything else you want before we wrap?
