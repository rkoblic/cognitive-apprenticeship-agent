**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a real moment, describe only observable behavior, use an owned impact statement—and you can spot where judgment sneaks into the behavior line. I’ll demonstrate first so you can hear the moves—ready to start?

**carlos_SBI:**

Yeah, go ahead. Let’s keep it quick.

**MentorAI:**

Great—here’s a quick demo.

1) Anchor it: In Tuesday’s standup when we were reviewing release blockers. 
2) Describe only what a camera would catch (skip labels like “dismissive”): you started talking while I was mid-sentence and spoke over me twice. 
3) Own the impact: I felt flustered and lost my train of thought, and we ran past the timebox so I didn’t flag the risk. 
4) Put it together in one or two sentences.

What did you notice about how I kept judgment out and owned the impact?

**carlos_SBI:**

You didn’t use labels—just what happened. And you owned it with “I felt.” Looks fine to me. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Quick check: In this line—“In Monday’s retro, you were dismissive and kept shutting down ideas, which made me feel it was unprofessional”—where is judgment sneaking in?

**carlos_SBI:**

“Unprofessional.” That’s the judgment. The rest looks fine. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

You’re right about “unprofessional.” There’s one more judgment leak in that line—can you spot it?

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine—“dismissive.” Same thing. Can we keep going?

**MentorAI:**

Your turn: write a full SBI for a real recent moment from your work—one or two sentences that anchor to a specific interaction, describe only what a camera would catch, and own your impact. What’s your draft?

**carlos_SBI:**

Last week in meetings, you were dismissive and kept shutting people down. It was awkward and caused problems for the discussion.

**MentorAI:**

Quick one before I weigh in: which part do you think I’ll push back on most—your anchor, the behavior description, or the impact—and why?

**carlos_SBI:**

Behavior. You’ll say “dismissive” and “shutting people down” aren’t camera-view. It’s fine though—can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Heard—let’s keep it tight. Run the quick SBI self-check on your draft: 1) is the moment a single recognizable meeting (not “last week in meetings”)? 2) would a camera capture the behavior words? 3) does the impact use “I” and name my feeling or a direct consequence I experienced? Based on that, make one edit to the weakest part and share the revised line.

**carlos_SBI:**

Revised: Last week in meetings, you talked over people twice and kept shutting people down. It was awkward and caused problems for the discussion.

**MentorAI:**

“Talked over people twice” is solid—camera-view. The anchor’s still too broad. Which single meeting was this—name it (e.g., Tuesday’s standup) and update your first clause to match, then share the revised sentence? 👍

**carlos_SBI:**

Updated: In Tuesday’s standup, you talked over people twice and kept shutting people down. It was awkward and caused problems for the discussion.

**MentorAI:**

You’re moving fast—cool. On “kept shutting people down,” run the camera test: what exactly did they do or say—e.g., a specific phrase they used or a move like redirecting the agenda— that we could point to once? Swap that in and share the revised line.

**carlos_SBI:**

Revised: In Tuesday’s standup, you talked over people twice and said “let’s move on.” It was awkward and caused problems for the discussion.

**MentorAI:**

You’re close—anchor and behavior land. For impact, can you rewrite “It was awkward and caused problems for the discussion” as an “I” statement that names what you felt or a direct consequence you experienced in that moment, then share the full line?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, you talked over people twice and said “let’s move on.” I felt it was awkward and it caused problems for the discussion.

**MentorAI:**

You wrote “I felt it was awkward”—what were you trying to capture with that wording?

**carlos_SBI:**

Just that it was awkward and threw the discussion off. That’s all I meant. Can we keep going?

**MentorAI:**

Got it—keeping it moving. Translate “awkward” into what you actually felt (e.g., uneasy, flustered) and name one direct consequence you personally experienced in that moment (e.g., I lost my train of thought). Update just the impact and share the full line?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, you talked over people twice and said “let’s move on.” I felt annoyed and the meeting ran over.

**MentorAI:**

Nice speed. One more tighten: “the meeting ran over” describes the meeting, not your experience—can you rewrite that as the impact on you in that moment (e.g., “I didn’t finish my point”) and share the full line?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, you talked over people twice and said “let’s move on.” I felt annoyed and didn’t finish my point; it caused problems for the discussion. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Almost there. Drop “it caused problems for the discussion” or convert it into an “I …” consequence you experienced, then share the tightened one-sentence version. What’s your final line?

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, you talked over people twice and said “let’s move on,” I felt annoyed and I think it caused problems. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you’re ready to move on—this is one edit away. Drop “I think it caused problems” or swap it for a direct “I …” consequence like “I didn’t finish my point.” Post your final one-sentence version.

**carlos_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, you talked over people twice and said “let’s move on.” I felt annoyed and didn’t finish my point. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

That lands 👍. New variation: In last Thursday’s client demo with Acme, your manager cut in while you were answering the client’s security question, gave a different answer, and moved the agenda forward—write the one- to two-sentence SBI you’d deliver to your manager. What’s your draft?

**carlos_SBI:**

In the Acme demo last week, you undermined me by cutting in and giving a different answer, then moving on. It was awkward and made us look inconsistent.

**MentorAI:**

Direct hit on the anchor; the main issue is judgment in “undermined me.” Drop that label and keep only the observable actions, then share your revised one- to two-sentence draft.

**carlos_SBI:**

Fine—updated: In last Thursday’s client demo with Acme, you cut in while I was answering the client’s security question, gave a different answer, and moved the agenda forward. It was awkward and made us look inconsistent. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Anchor and behavior land. The impact misses—“It was awkward and made us look inconsistent” isn’t owned and reads as a judgment. Rewrite the impact as an “I …” statement that names what you felt and a direct consequence you experienced in that moment, then share your revised one- to two-sentence draft?

**carlos_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s client demo with Acme, you cut in while I was answering the client’s security question, gave a different answer, and moved the agenda forward. I felt frustrated and I think it made me look out of the loop. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Heard—keeping it tight. Replace “I think it made me look out of the loop” with an owned “I …” consequence you directly experienced in that moment, then post your revised two-sentence draft.

**carlos_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s client demo with Acme, you cut in while I was answering the client’s security question, gave a different answer, and moved the agenda forward. I felt frustrated and lost my place, and it made us look inconsistent. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

Noted you want to move fast—one fix left. Anchor and behavior land; the impact starts owned (“I felt frustrated and lost my place”) and then leaks judgment with “made us look inconsistent.” Revise to keep only owned impact—your feeling and a direct consequence you experienced in that moment—and share the updated line.

**carlos_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s client demo with Acme, you cut in while I was answering the client’s security question, gave a different answer, and moved the agenda forward. I felt frustrated and lost my place. Can we move on?

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar—both attempts land. Quick reflection: what’s the one principle you’ll carry forward next time to keep judgment out?
