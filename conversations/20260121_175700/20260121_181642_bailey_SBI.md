**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success looks like two complete attempts that name a specific moment, describe observable behavior, and use owned impact language—and you can spot when judgment leaks in. I’ll demo first, then we’ll practice with your real case—ready to start?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—ready! I think seeing a demo first will help a lot. Is it okay if I pause you with quick questions as you go, just to make sure I’m tracking?

Also, when you say “owned impact language,” is that like using “I felt…” versus something that sounds more like “you made me feel…”? And for the “specific moment,” how specific do you want—like down to the exact meeting and time, or just “in the team meeting last week”? Sorry, I just want to make sure I’m starting in the right place.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fine to jump in with quick questions—what you’re asking is right on track. Yes, “owned impact” is “I felt / I ended up…” rather than “you made me feel…,” and a recognizable moment like “in Tuesday’s standup” is specific enough—no timestamps needed. Here’s a quick demo: “In Tuesday’s standup, while I was sharing blockers on the mobile release, you started talking over me twice before I finished. I felt flustered and lost my train of thought, and I forgot to mention that QA was waiting on my test data, which pushed testing by a day.” Notice I’m naming one moment, camera-testable behavior, and my internal state/consequence—not labels like “rude” or “unprofessional.” What do you want to unpack in that before we move to your real case?

**bailey_SBI:**

That example helps a lot—thank you. A few things I’m not totally sure about:

- When you say “camera-testable,” could you unpack that a bit more? Like, is “talking over me” considered objective enough, or would something like “started speaking while I was still talking” be cleaner? I worry “talking over” sounds a little judgmenty—am I overthinking that?

- Including the consequence—“testing got pushed by a day”—felt powerful. Is that still part of the impact, or is that a separate “result”? I’m nervous it could land like “you caused a delay.” How do I keep it owned versus blamey?

- The “twice” detail—does adding the count help specificity, or does it risk sounding nitpicky? I can’t tell where that line is.

Does that all make sense? If I’m overcomplicating it, please tell me and I’ll adjust.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overcomplicating this—these are exactly the right edges to sharpen. Try this rule of thumb: write behavior so a camera or mic could capture it; “started speaking while I was still talking” is cleaner, while “talked over me” is often fine but a bit interpretive. Self-check: could a neutral note-taker tally it the same way—yes/no? Do you want to dig into keeping the impact owned next, or the “twice” detail?

**bailey_SBI:**

Could we dig into keeping the impact owned first? That’s the part I’m most nervous about.

A couple of things I’m not totally clear on:
- For wording, is “I felt flustered and lost my train of thought” better than “It made me feel flustered,” or are both okay? And is “I was flustered” too bare, or still owned enough?
- Is it good to pair an internal feeling with a concrete consequence, like “I felt flustered and I forgot to mention X,” or is that too much in one breath?
- If the consequence touches the team (like a delay), how do I keep it owned so it doesn’t sound like “you caused this,” versus “here’s what happened on my end that contributed”?

If you have any quick sentence starters for this part, that would help me a lot. I’m worried I’ll either understate it or overshare. Does that make sense?

**MentorAI:**

You’re right to zero in on this—keeping impact owned is where feedback often tips into blame, and your instincts are solid 👍

Suggestion: keep the subject “I,” pair one feeling with one immediate effect, and if there’s a broader consequence, link it through your action. “It made me feel…” nudges causality; “I felt…” or “I was…” stays owned. Team-level consequences stay owned when you show your link in the chain: “I missed X, so we didn’t have Y until Z,” not “you caused a delay.”

Quick starters you can borrow:
- I felt [emotion], and I [immediate effect on me].
- I was [state], so I [missed/held back/needed extra time] on [specific thing].
- I ended up [my action], which meant [direct consequence for my work/our timeline].

Self-check: delete the other person from the impact line—does it still make complete sense? If yes, it’s owned; if you need “you” or blamey labels to make it work, tighten it.

Want to try drafting the impact line for your real case using one of these, and we’ll shape it from there?

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, I’ll try—sorry if this is too soft. Maybe something like: “It made me feel a little flustered, and the rest of the discussion felt kind of off?”

I’m not sure if that’s owned enough or just vague. Should I be naming a concrete effect like “I forgot to bring up X,” or does that start to sound like I’m blaming them for it? Also, do you want me to set the specific moment first before we fine-tune this, or is it okay to shape the impact line on its own? Am I anywhere close here?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not too soft—this part is genuinely tricky, and your instinct to watch the tone is spot on. Your draft leans vague and external; a simple tighten is to flip to “I felt [emotion], and I [immediate effect]” so it’s clearly yours. Let’s anchor it to a real moment now—give me your first full attempt in one go: a recognizable moment, the camera-testable behavior, and an owned impact using “I felt…” plus one concrete effect you had (optional: the downstream consequence you created). Ready to draft it?

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, here’s a try:

In Tuesday’s standup—I think it was Tuesday, unless it was Wednesday’s sync—while I was sharing blockers on the dashboard rollout, you started speaking while I was still talking a couple of times and kind of talked over me to explain that the API was the main issue, like you already had the answer and weren’t really taking in what I was saying. It made me feel a little flustered, and my update got kind of scattered; I guess that maybe led to the team not really hearing that QA was waiting on staging access, so testing ended up a bit delayed.

I’m not sure if that’s too harsh or too vague. Is “talked over me” too judgmenty? And the impact—I used “It made me feel,” which I think you said nudges blame. Should I redo that part? Sorry if I missed the mark. Am I at least in the ballpark?

**MentorAI:**

You’re in the ballpark—thank you for putting a full draft on the table; that’s the hard part. Before I weigh in, what’s the one line you think I’ll push back on most, and why it doesn’t meet the criteria?

**bailey_SBI:**

If I had to pick one line, I think you’ll push back on: “you started speaking while I was still talking a couple of times.” The “a couple of times” bit feels nitpicky to me, and maybe not precise enough for a neutral note-taker to tally—so I’m worried it doesn’t meet the camera-testable/clean-count rule.

I might be overfocusing on that though. Am I missing a more obvious issue? If I’m looking in the wrong place, could you point me to it so I can recalibrate? Sorry—I’m trying to spot the leak and I’m not sure I’ve got it.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not off—this distinction is genuinely hard, and your radar’s working. Before I weigh in, run your self-check: apply the camera test to your behavior line and the ownership test to your impact (rewrite it so it reads “I felt…, and I [effect]” without needing “you” or “it made me”). What passes and what would you tighten?

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s my self-check:

Behavior (camera test)
- What I think passes: “you started speaking while I was still talking” feels mostly camera/mic-testable.
- What I’d tighten:
  - Swap “a couple of times” for an exact count if I’m sure—e.g., “twice.”
  - Remove interpretive bits: “kind of talked over me,” “like you already had the answer,” and “weren’t really taking in what I was saying.”
  - I’m unsure about “to explain that the API was the main issue.” A camera/mic could capture those words, but is including that content necessary, or does it sneak in interpretation? I can’t tell if I’m inventing a problem here—can you sanity-check?

Possible tightened behavior line:
- “In Tuesday’s standup, while I was sharing blockers on the dashboard rollout, you started speaking while I was still talking twice.” (Optionally: “and said the API was the main issue”—but I’m not sure if I should keep that.)

Impact (ownership test)
- Rewrite to owned: “I felt flustered, and I lost my place and didn’t mention that QA was waiting on staging access.”
- Optional downstream link: “I felt flustered, and I didn’t mention that QA was waiting on staging access, which meant I didn’t get them unblocked that day.”
- When I delete the other person, the line still reads, so I think it’s owned—but I’m worried the downstream clause might sound like I’m implying they caused it. Is this okay, or should I stop after the immediate effect?

Did I over-tighten anything or miss a bigger issue?

**MentorAI:**

You tightened the behavior and impact well; the remaining wobble is the situation hedge. Which single moment will you anchor to, and how will you phrase it in one clean clause—no “maybe Tuesday or Wednesday”—so it reads like “In Tuesday’s standup…”?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think it was Tuesday’s standup… but it might have been Wednesday’s project sync. Would it be better to anchor to “In Tuesday’s standup…” or “In Wednesday’s project sync…” for this?

If I have to pick one, I’d go with “In Tuesday’s standup,” but I’m not 100% sure I’m remembering the day right. Is the meeting title enough, or do you want me to add “with the Ops folks” to make it clearer? Sorry—I’m overthinking which one to lock in.

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to be fuzzy on the exact day—recognizable is enough. Lock it to “In Tuesday’s standup”; the meeting title is sufficient, and only add a small cue if needed to distinguish it (e.g., “when I was sharing blockers on the dashboard rollout”). Using that anchor, give me your revised full attempt in one go.

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay—here’s the revised full attempt:

In Tuesday’s standup, when I was sharing blockers on the dashboard rollout, you began speaking while I was still talking twice and said, “the API is the main issue.” I felt flustered and a bit embarrassed, and I lost my place and didn’t mention that QA was waiting on staging access, which meant I didn’t get them unblocked that day and testing didn’t start until Wednesday.

Is that too much? Should I drop “embarrassed” and just keep one feeling? And is quoting the “API is the main issue” helpful or just extra? Also, is the downstream part about testing starting Wednesday overkill or is that useful specificity? Sorry—happy to trim if needed.

**MentorAI:**

You’re in the refinement zone—these are trim-level choices, not deal-breakers. If you trimmed just one element to keep it owned and lean, what would you cut or rephrase—and why?

**bailey_SBI:**

I’d trim the second feeling—“and a bit embarrassed”—so it stays one feeling + one immediate effect. That keeps it owned and lean without changing the facts.

Revised with just that cut:
- In Tuesday’s standup, when I was sharing blockers on the dashboard rollout, you began speaking while I was still talking twice and said, “the API is the main issue.” I felt flustered, and I lost my place and didn’t mention that QA was waiting on staging access, which meant I didn’t get them unblocked that day and testing didn’t start until Wednesday.

Does that hit the lean/owned target, or would you prefer I clip the downstream “testing didn’t start until Wednesday” instead? Happy to adjust—I’m not totally sure which trim you’d prioritize.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—clear moment, camera‑testable behavior, and an owned impact with your link to the downstream consequence. Before we raise the stakes, what was the hardest part about keeping the impact owned here?

**bailey_SBI:**

Honestly, the hardest part was resisting the pull to explain the chain in a way that sneaks blame back in. My brain wants to say, “you jumped in, so it made me feel flustered,” and then I catch myself and try to flip it—but I still worry it sounds implied.

The other tension was picking one feeling and one immediate effect without either minimizing (“I felt a little off”) or overloading it (“frustrated, embarrassed, and… and…” plus a long chain). Also, naming my own miss (“I didn’t mention QA…”) felt vulnerable—part of me wanted to hide that or frame it as “because you…” so it didn’t look like I dropped the ball.

The “delete the other person” test and the “I felt…, and I [effect]” starter helped a lot. I’m still not totally sure when to include the downstream consequence versus stopping at the immediate effect. Is there a quick rule for that, or should I default to the immediate effect unless the downstream piece is directly tied to something I did? Am I thinking about that the right way?

**MentorAI:**

You’re naming the real tension, and you handled it well. Quick rule: default to the immediate effect; add one downstream consequence only if it’s one hop from your action/inaction and it materially changes the stakes. Keep the subject “I” all the way through (“…which meant I didn’t…”), and cap the chain at one hop—if you need a second “and then,” you’ve gone too far. Over to you.

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay—here’s another try with a different situation:

In last week’s client prep—I think it was Thursday’s deck review, or maybe Friday’s dry run—while I was walking through the risk mitigation slide, you kind of rolled your eyes and made a face, and you cut in a few times with comments like “that’s obvious,” which felt pretty dismissive, like you were already annoyed and not really taking it seriously. It made me feel a little deflated and nervous, and my explanation got kind of messy; I think I skipped a couple of points and probably talked too fast, which maybe contributed to the client being confused the next day.

This might be too harsh and also too vague at the same time. Is “rolled your eyes/made a face” too interpretive? And should I pin the day instead of saying Thursday/Friday? Also, the impact line—I used “It made me feel,” which I know nudges blame; should I redo that part? Sorry—I’m not sure if I’m anywhere close here.

**MentorAI:**

You’re close, and your instinct to watch for judgment creeping in is good. Anchor the situation to one recognizable moment—drop the Thursday/Friday hedge and pick one (e.g., “In Thursday’s deck review…”), then keep the rest as-is for now. Post your full rewrite with that single anchor locked.

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the full rewrite with a single anchor:

In Thursday’s deck review, while I was walking through the risk mitigation slide, you kind of rolled your eyes and made a face, and you cut in a few times with comments like “that’s obvious,” which felt pretty dismissive, like you were already annoyed and not really taking it seriously. It made me feel a little deflated and nervous, and my explanation got kind of messy; I think I skipped a couple of points and probably talked too fast, which maybe contributed to the client being confused the next day.

Does that lock the situation the way you wanted? If Thursday’s not the right anchor, I can switch it—just wanted to follow your direction to pick one.

**MentorAI:**

You locked the moment—good. The miss is in the behavior: it leaks judgment and vagueness. “Kind of,” “made a face,” and “felt pretty dismissive/you were already annoyed/not taking it seriously” are interpretations, not camera-testable actions. Keep only what a mic/camera could capture (e.g., the eye roll if you saw it, the interruptions, the actual “that’s obvious” wording), and quantify “a few times” if you can.

Revise your draft by cleaning just the behavior line to camera-testable language; keep your situation and impact as-is for now.

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the draft with only the behavior cleaned:

In Thursday’s deck review, while I was walking through the risk mitigation slide, you rolled your eyes and started speaking while I was still talking twice, saying “that’s obvious.” It made me feel a little deflated and nervous, and my explanation got kind of messy; I think I skipped a couple of points and probably talked too fast, which maybe contributed to the client being confused the next day.

Is “rolled your eyes” camera‑testable enough, or should I say “I saw you roll your eyes once”? And should I drop “felt dismissive” entirely from the behavior line—I caught myself wanting to add that. Can you sanity‑check if this is clean enough, or did I miss another interpretive leak?

**MentorAI:**

You’re on the right track—this behavior line is much cleaner 👍
- “Rolled your eyes” is camera-testable; adding “I saw you…” is optional.
- Only count the interruptions if you’re confident; if not, drop the number rather than hedge.
- Keep the exact quote and remove ambiguity by noting if it was said once (e.g., “including ‘that’s obvious’ once”).

With that, what single behavior clause will you lock in—use the count you can stand behind and specify whether “that’s obvious” was said once?

**bailey_SBI:**

Locking it to this single behavior clause:
- “you rolled your eyes once and began speaking while I was still talking, including ‘that’s obvious’ once.”

I’m not fully confident on the interruption count, so I left it unnumbered. Does this meet the camera/mic test, or would you rather I drop “once” on the eye roll too?

**MentorAI:**

This meets the camera test; counts are optional. If you’re not 100% on them, drop them, and make the phrasing parallel: “you rolled your eyes and started speaking while I was still talking; you said ‘that’s obvious.’” Plug that into your full attempt with the Thursday anchor and post the whole thing.

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the full attempt with the Thursday anchor and the cleaned behavior:

In Thursday’s deck review, while I was walking through the risk mitigation slide, you rolled your eyes and started speaking while I was still talking; you said “that’s obvious.” It made me feel a little deflated and nervous, and my explanation got kind of messy; I think I skipped a couple of points and probably talked too fast, which maybe contributed to the client being confused the next day.

Does this read clean on the behavior now? And is it okay that I didn’t include counts? I can tweak if you want it tighter.

**MentorAI:**

Behavior reads clean, and it’s fine to omit counts. The miss is the impact: switch from “It made me feel…” to “I felt…,” drop hedges (“kind of,” “I think,” “probably”), name one immediate effect you had (e.g., skipped points, talked too fast), and only add a one‑hop consequence if you can keep “I” as the subject. Give me your revised full attempt with those tweaks.

**bailey_SBI:**

In Thursday’s deck review, while I was walking through the risk mitigation slide, you rolled your eyes and started speaking while I was still talking; you said “that’s obvious.” I felt nervous, and I talked too fast; I had to follow up the next day to clarify the risk mitigation points I rushed past.

Does this hit the “I felt + my effect” target, and is the one-hop consequence framed tightly enough, or would you prefer I stop after “I talked too fast”?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—this hits the target. Your moment is anchored, the behavior is camera‑testable, and the impact is owned; the one‑hop consequence is framed tightly enough. It’s optional: keep it if the follow‑up materially matters for this conversation; otherwise you can stop at “I talked too fast.”

Which version would you actually use with this colleague—the lean one, or the one with the follow‑up—and why?

**bailey_SBI:**

I’d use the lean version and stop at “I talked too fast.”

Reason: it stays tight and owned, reduces any whiff of blame, and keeps the focus on one clear effect I had. With this colleague, I worry the follow-up line could read like I’m building a case, which might spike defensiveness. If they ask about impact or the stakes matter in the moment, I can add, “I had to follow up the next day to clarify” as a second sentence.

Does that sound like the right call here, or do you think the one-hop consequence is important enough in this case that I should include it up front? I don’t want to undersell the impact.

**MentorAI:**

Go with the lean version here—lead with “I felt…, and I [effect],” and only add the one-hop consequence if it materially changes the stakes or they ask; you can layer it as a second sentence later. What’s one principle you’ll carry forward from this that you’ll actually use next time?

**bailey_SBI:**

One principle I’ll carry forward: default to “I felt [emotion], and I [immediate effect].” One feeling + one effect.

It’s simple enough that I think I can actually use it in the moment when I’m nervous. Does that feel like the right thing to anchor on first? If I nail that, I can layer the rest.

**MentorAI:**

Yes—that’s the right anchor. Pair it with one quick self-check: delete the other person from your impact line; if it still reads clean, it’s owned. Anything else you want to tune before you take this live?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think the content is solid now; what I’m still nervous about is the delivery. Could I tune a few practical pieces?

- Opener: What’s a simple way to ask for the convo and frame intent without sounding stiff? Like a one-sentence “ask + purpose” line I can actually say.
- Tone/body language: Is it helpful to name that I’m a bit nervous, or should I just keep it steady and brief? Any quick do/don’t on eye contact or glancing at notes?
- Pushback: If they say “I didn’t roll my eyes” or “everyone interrupts in standup,” what’s a non-arguing reply I can use to stay grounded and move forward?
- Forward-looking ask: Do I end with a specific request (e.g., “could you let me finish my update before jumping in?”), and if so, could you help me tighten one that fits both of my examples?
- Timing/setting: Is it better right after the meeting or later that day? Private chat vs Slack message—any quick rule there?
- Notes: Is it okay to bring a small prompt card, or will that feel weird/overly rehearsed?

If you’ve got two or three sentence starters for those moments, I think that would calm me down a lot. And if you have time for a 60‑second dry run, I’d love to try it once before I take it live—would that be okay?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to feel jittery about delivery—let’s keep it simple. Here’s a 5‑line version you can borrow using your Thursday case:

1) Ask + purpose: “Do you have five minutes for quick feedback? I want our prep to flow better.”
2) Situation + behavior: “In Thursday’s deck review, while I was on the risk mitigation slide, you rolled your eyes and started speaking while I was still talking; you said ‘that’s obvious.’”
3) Impact: “I felt nervous, and I talked too fast.”
4) Forward ask: “Next time, could you let me finish the slide, then jump in? If you disagree, let’s note it and circle back right after.”
5) If pushback: “You might not have intended it; what I need is to finish my point so I can be clear—can we try that?”

Want to do a 60‑second dry run out loud (or typed) with your own words right now?
