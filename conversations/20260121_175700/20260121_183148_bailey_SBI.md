**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the Situation–Behavior–Impact framework. Success means naming a specific moment, describing camera-testable behavior, and owning your impact (your emotion or consequence). I’ll model how I do it first—ready to start?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—ready. I’d really like to hear your example. Quick question before we start: when you say “camera-testable,” that means something you could literally see or hear on a recording—like no mind-reading—right?

Would it be okay if you pause after each part so I can jot a couple notes and check I’m tracking? And if I have a clarifying question while you model, is it okay to ask, or should I wait until the end? Sorry, I just want to make sure I don’t miss anything.

**MentorAI:**

You’re reading this right—camera-testable means something a mic/camera could capture, no mind-reading. It’s fine to pause: I’ll model and stop after Situation, then Behavior, then Impact; you can jump in with clarifying questions during those pauses. Ready for me to start the demo now?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—ready! Thank you for pausing between parts.

One quick thing before you start: could you say out loud which part you’re on (“Situation,” “Behavior,” “Impact”) when you pause so I can label my notes? Also, for the “Situation,” is something like “Tuesday standup” specific enough, or do you prefer a timestamp like “Tuesday, 9:05 a.m., in the standup”? I can hold that question until the first pause if that’s better—just let me know.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overdoing it—labeling helps, and yes, “Tuesday standup” is specific enough; no timestamp needed. I’ll model and pause between parts.

Situation: in Tuesday’s standup, right after the last sprint update when the team shifted to blockers. I’m choosing that recognizable moment (not “lately in meetings”) so we can both locate it easily. Pause on Situation—any clarifying questions before I move to Behavior?

**bailey_SBI:**

That helps—“Tuesday’s standup, right after we shifted to blockers” feels easy to locate.

A couple quick clarifying questions:
- Is “when we shifted to blockers” still considered situation/context, not behavior? I’m trying to get the boundary right so I don’t accidentally mix parts.
- How much context is useful here—would you ever add who was present (“with the core dev team”), or is that extra unless it matters for the feedback?
- If there were two similar standups that week and I’m worried they won’t remember, is it okay to add one more anchor like “the standup after the release retro,” or does that get too busy?

If those are clear, I’m ready for the Behavior part. Does that make sense?

**MentorAI:**

You’re drawing the right boundaries. Quick rules of thumb: that “when we shifted to blockers” belongs in the moment-setting; behavior is what the person did/said. Add who/where only if it disambiguates or matters for the feedback. If there were two similar meetings, one extra anchor like “the standup after the release retro” is helpful—keep it to one clean extra cue. Ready for me to move to Behavior?

**bailey_SBI:**

That clears it up—thank you. I’m good on the Situation piece.

Yes, ready for Behavior. I have a couple questions queued up about quoting vs paraphrasing and what to do if there are multiple small behaviors, but I can wait for the Behavior pause to ask—does that work?

**MentorAI:**

Behavior: you spoke over Priya mid-sentence during her blocker update, said “let’s move on to the release checklist,” and redirected the discussion; this happened twice in that segment. I’m anchoring to words they can hear (one short quote), naming frequency (“twice”), and staying with one behavior cluster (interrupting/redirecting) without adding motives or judgments.

Pause on Behavior—what are your questions about quoting vs. paraphrasing or handling multiple small behaviors?

**bailey_SBI:**

This is really helpful—thank you. A few questions:

On quoting vs. paraphrasing:
- Is the general rule to paraphrase unless the exact phrase matters (like a clear directive or a charged word), and then quote that short phrase?
- If I’m not 100% sure I remember the wording, is it better to paraphrase cleanly rather than say “you said something like…”? I worry that “something like” sounds fuzzy.
- Does quoting ever come off as mimicking someone’s tone? Should I keep quotes to short, neutral snippets and avoid trying to capture tone?
- Tiny detail: is it okay to simplify filler words (“um,” “like”) out of a quote, or does that cross a line?

On multiple small behaviors:
- If I saw a few things (e.g., two interruptions, plus a side comment in chat, plus checking the phone), is the move to pick one behavior cluster that ties to my main impact and save the rest for later?
- When there are closely related actions (interrupting twice and then redirecting twice), is that still one cluster or does redirecting count as a separate one?
- For frequency, if I’m not certain whether it was twice or three times, is “a couple of times” acceptable, or is that too vague for the “camera-test” standard?
- Is it okay to say upfront, “I noticed a couple of things—can I focus on the interruptions first?” so I don’t overload them? Or is that too meta for the moment?

Sorry for the barrage—does that all make sense? I just want to make sure I’m applying this in a way that won’t make someone defensive. Am I thinking about this the right way?

**MentorAI:**

You’re asking craft-level questions—totally normal, and it shows you care about landing this well 👍

Quoting vs. paraphrasing:
- Default to paraphrase; quote only the few words that shape impact (directives, charged labels), and keep quotes short.
- If you’re not sure of exact wording, paraphrase cleanly—skip “something like.” E.g., “you moved us to the release checklist.”
- Quotes can feel mocking if you perform tone; stick to short, neutral content. If tone matters and is observable, describe it: “your volume was louder than usual.”
- It’s fine to drop fillers in a quote if it doesn’t change meaning.

Multiple behaviors:
- Pick one behavior cluster tied to your main impact; park the rest for later.
- Interrupting + redirecting can be one cluster if they function together toward the same impact; split only if the impacts differ.
- If uncertain on count, “more than once” or “at least twice” is better than “a couple of times.”
- Framing focus is good: “I noticed a few things—can we focus on the interruptions first?”

Ready for me to model the Impact piece now?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—ready for the Impact piece.

As you model, could you flag the specific emotion word and any consequence you include? I’ve got a couple questions queued for the pause—like whether it’s okay to include both a feeling and a consequence, whether “I felt…” is better than “It made me feel…,” and how precise to be on intensity (e.g., “frustrated” vs “a bit frustrated”). I’ll hold those until you pause if that’s okay. Does that work?

**MentorAI:**

Impact: I felt frustrated and hesitant to jump back in, and I left the standup without sharing my blocker; I had to follow up with you afterward. I’m naming my own emotion and a concrete consequence, avoiding judgments like “I felt it was dismissive.” Emotion: frustrated. Consequence: I left without sharing my blocker and had to DM you after. 

Pause on Impact—go ahead with your questions about feeling vs. consequence, “I felt” wording, and intensity.

**bailey_SBI:**

This is super clear—thank you. A few questions so I don’t misapply this:

- Emotion + consequence: Is the default to include both if I can, with emotion first and then one concrete consequence? If I only choose one, is the consequence enough on its own, or should I prioritize naming the emotion?

- “I felt” vs “It made me feel”: Is “I felt…” preferred for ownership, and “It made me feel…” acceptable but a bit weaker? Also, are words like “dismissed”/“ignored” considered judgments more than emotions? Would “embarrassed,” “frustrated,” “anxious,” “hesitant” be safer true-feelings words?

- Intensity: How much to qualify—e.g., “frustrated” vs “a bit frustrated” vs “really frustrated”? Do softeners like “a bit” dilute it too much, or is a light qualifier okay if it’s accurate?

- If I’m not comfortable naming an emotion: Is it acceptable to focus on a personal consequence instead (“I held back for the rest of the meeting”), or to use a behavior-like feeling proxy (“I was hesitant to jump back in”)?

- Broader impact: Is it okay to add one team-level consequence if it’s factual (“we didn’t surface my blocker in the meeting”), or is that too much for the Impact line?

- Duration: Can I note time scope (“for the rest of the standup” vs “for the week”) without sounding dramatic, as long as it’s accurate?

- Length: Your model was one clean sentence with an emotion plus one consequence. Is that the norm—aim for one sentence, one feeling word, one consequence?

Does that all make sense? Sorry if I’m overthinking—I just want to make sure I’m not sliding into judgment-y language. Am I thinking about this roughly the right way?

**MentorAI:**

You’re thinking about exactly the right edges—this is how you keep it clear without sounding judgy.

- Emotion + consequence: Default to include both if you can—emotion first, then one concrete consequence. If you only pick one, either is fine; choose the one that communicates your impact most clearly.
- “I felt” vs “It made me feel”: Prefer “I felt…” for ownership. “It made me feel…” suggests blame—avoid if you can. Words like “embarrassed,” “frustrated,” “anxious,” “hesitant” are clean feelings; “dismissed/ignored” can read as a judgment—use sparingly or pair with a concrete consequence.
- Intensity: Use the truest level (“a bit frustrated,” “really frustrated”)—qualifiers are fine if accurate. Don’t understate just to soften.
- If you don’t want to name an emotion: A personal consequence or behavioral proxy you experienced (“I held back for the rest of the meeting,” “I hesitated to jump in”) works.
- Broader impact: One factual team-level consequence is okay if directly tied and concise.
- Duration: Brief scope (“for the rest of the standup”) is fine if accurate.
- Length: Aim for one clean sentence; two short ones if needed.

Before we move to your first attempt, if you wrote yourself a one-line checklist for drafting the Impact line, what would it say?

**bailey_SBI:**

Maybe: In one short sentence, say how it made me feel and, if helpful, one brief consequence I experienced, keeping it about me and avoiding labels or blame.

Is that too soft or vague? Should I literally start with “I felt…” and always include one consequence? Sorry—can you sanity-check this line for me?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—your line is solid; just tighten two things: make “I felt…” your default opener, and treat the consequence as optional. Try this: Lead with “I felt [emotion],” then—if helpful—add one concrete consequence I experienced; keep it owned and judgment‑free, one clean sentence. Would you use that as your self-check?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes, I can use that. I wrote it down as: Lead with “I felt [emotion],” then—if helpful—add one concrete consequence I experienced; keep it owned and judgment‑free, one clean sentence.

Is “judgment‑free” enough of a reminder to avoid labels like “dismissed/ignored,” or should I explicitly note “use true-feeling words”? And do you think I should add “camera‑testable consequence” in the line, or is that overkill since the consequence should be concrete by default?

Sorry for nitpicking—I just want to make sure this checklist won’t steer me wrong in the moment. Does this look good as-is?

**MentorAI:**

Good instincts—make the reminders explicit. Try this final line: Lead with “I felt [true feeling word],” then—if helpful—add one camera‑testable consequence I experienced; keep it owned and judgment‑free, one clean sentence. Does that wording work for you?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—that wording works for me. I’ve got it as: Lead with “I felt [true feeling word],” then—if helpful—add one camera‑testable consequence I experienced; keep it owned and judgment‑free, one clean sentence.

Tiny edge case: does “hesitant” count as a true feeling word for this, or is that more of a behavior proxy compared to “anxious” or “embarrassed”? And is it okay to include a simple intensity (“a bit frustrated”) within that same one sentence?

If that sounds right, I’m ready to try my first attempt. Could you cue me on which part to start with? I think I might need help picking the situation.

**MentorAI:**

Quick edges: “hesitant” works as a felt state; if you can name the underlying emotion (e.g., anxious, embarrassed), even better—but not required. A simple intensity like “a bit frustrated” is fine if it’s accurate. Let’s start your attempt: give me the situation in one line—a real, findable moment (meeting name plus one anchor like “after we switched to blockers”).

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, um—maybe Tuesday’s standup… after we shifted to blockers? But now I’m second‑guessing—last week’s product sync might be clearer, or maybe the standup after the release retro? There’ve been a few similar moments, so I’m not sure which one is best to use.

Do you want me to pick one of those, and if so, which would you recommend? Sorry—I just want to pick a useful example.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like picking the moment is the sticky part—totally normal. Use this quick chooser:
- The one where you can recall a specific quote or action
- Where your impact was clearest for you
- If tied, pick the most recent

Go ahead and name the situation in one line.

**bailey_SBI:**

Situation: Tuesday’s standup, right after we switched to blockers—the one right after the release retro—on Zoom with the core dev team.

Is that specific enough, or did I overpack it? I can trim it down if that’s better. Sorry—I wasn’t sure how much to include.

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to worry about overpacking—this is specific enough. One extra anchor is plenty; the “on Zoom with the core dev team” bit is optional unless who-heard-it matters. You can keep it as is or trim that last clause—your call. Now give me the rest in one go: the behavior and the impact.

**bailey_SBI:**

Behavior: You spoke over Priya mid‑sentence during her blocker update and said “let’s move on to the release checklist,” redirecting the discussion—I think it happened twice. It seemed like you were a bit impatient and kind of dismissive, like you’d already decided her blocker wasn’t important, and you kept steering away from it.

Impact: It made things feel a bit off and kind of rushed, and I guess I pulled back a little—I maybe didn’t share as much, and the vibe felt less collaborative?

Is that the right level of detail, or am I being too judgy here? Sorry if I overdid it.

**MentorAI:**

You got a full draft down—that’s the hard part, and some judgment creep at this stage is totally normal. Before I give feedback, if I were to circle one specific phrase as leaking judgment rather than staying camera‑testable, which phrase would you pick to revise first?

**bailey_SBI:**

I’m not totally sure, but I keep tripping over “you spoke over Priya”—that feels like it might be judgment-y? Or maybe “redirecting the discussion” is interpretive.

If I have to pick one to revise first, I’d choose “spoke over Priya.” Does that make sense, or am I missing the real issue? Sorry—I can’t tell if I’m overthinking this.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not missing it—this is the spot where judgment creeps in. “Spoke over Priya mid-sentence” actually passes the camera test; the leaks are “impatient,” “dismissive,” and “already decided.” Tighten the behavior to what a mic would capture: keep the overlap, the short quote, and the frequency; drop motive labels. Give me that one behavior line now.

**bailey_SBI:**

Behavior: You spoke over Priya mid‑sentence during her blocker update and said “let’s move on to the release checklist”; that sequence happened twice in that segment.

Is that tight enough, or should I swap “spoke over” for “started talking while she was still speaking” to be safer?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—both phrasings are camera‑testable; “spoke over” is fine if it’s how you’d naturally say it. Using your checklist, rewrite your Impact as one clean sentence: lead with “I felt [true feeling],” then add one camera‑testable consequence if helpful—go ahead and draft it.

**bailey_SBI:**

Impact: I felt a bit anxious and frustrated, and I stayed quiet for the rest of the blockers segment and didn’t share my blocker.

Is that too packed—should I trim to just one consequence (e.g., “I didn’t share my blocker”)? And is “a bit” softening it too much? Sorry—happy to tighten it.

**MentorAI:**

You’re close—this reads clear and owned. To sharpen it, trim to one feeling word; choose the one that best matches for you, and keep “a bit” only if it’s truly accurate. Keep the rest as is for now. Go ahead and rewrite your Impact with that single emotion.

**bailey_SBI:**

Impact: I felt frustrated, and I stayed quiet for the rest of the blockers segment and didn’t share my blocker.

Does that land better? Or would “I felt a bit anxious” be more accurate since I hesitated? I’m not totally sure which is truer—happy to adjust.

**MentorAI:**

You’re right at the finish line here—both could fit, and picking the truest word is genuinely the hard part. Think back to your internal signals: which was more vivid in the moment—irritation at the interruption (pointing to frustrated) or nervous energy that made you hold back (pointing to anxious)?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think the nervous energy was more vivid—so “anxious.”

Impact: I felt anxious, and I stayed quiet for the rest of the blockers segment and didn’t share my blocker.

Does that read clean and owned to you, or would you tweak anything?

**MentorAI:**

That reads clean and owned. For a higher‑stakes variation: in Thursday’s cross‑functional product sync, right after the roadmap update—with the VP of Eng on the call—you’re giving feedback to Jordan (a senior engineer from another team) who twice interrupted the PM, redirected to “the release checklist,” and added a chat aside, “this is going in circles.” Give me your full SBI in one pass.

**bailey_SBI:**

Situation: In Thursday’s cross‑functional product sync—right after the roadmap update, I think—the one with the VP of Eng on the call.

Behavior: You spoke over the PM a couple of times and said “let’s move on to the release checklist,” redirecting the discussion, and you added a chat aside, “this is going in circles.” It came across as a bit impatient and kind of dismissive, like you’d already decided the PM’s point wasn’t helpful, and your tone felt a little sharp.

Impact: It made the meeting feel tense and a bit rushed, and I guess it sort of undermined the PM’s point; I maybe held back after that, and it seemed like others did too.

Is that too judgment-y or messy? I can tighten it—sorry if I overdid the interpretation.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overdoing it—higher‑stakes drafts often pull in interpretation. Here’s the key fix to make first: tighten your Impact to owned language—one true feeling and one camera‑testable consequence you personally experienced; drop “made the meeting feel…,” “undermined the PM’s point,” and “others did too.” Give me just your revised Impact line now.

**bailey_SBI:**

Impact: I felt anxious, and I didn’t speak again during that agenda item.

Does that hit the mark, or should I make the consequence slightly more specific (e.g., “I didn’t ask the question I’d planned”)?

**MentorAI:**

Your impact line lands; “I didn’t speak again during that agenda item” is camera-testable, and swapping to “I didn’t ask the question I’d planned” is great if that’s true—but not required. The real miss now is in your behavior line: “came across as… impatient/dismissive,” “you’d already decided,” and “tone felt sharp” are interpretations, not observable actions—strip those and keep only what a mic would catch (interrupting twice, the “release checklist” redirect, the chat “this is going in circles”). Give me your full SBI again with that behavior line cleaned to observable actions only.
