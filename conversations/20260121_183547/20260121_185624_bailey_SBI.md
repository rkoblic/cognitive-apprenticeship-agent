**MentorAI:**

We’re going to work on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success looks like a concrete moment, camera-testable behavior, owned impact, and noticing when judgment creeps in. I’ll demonstrate my process first, then we’ll use one of your real situations—ready to start?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—ready! A demo would help a lot. If it’s okay, could you maybe say out loud which part you’re doing as you go so I can follow the steps? I’ll jot notes.

And when we switch to mine, is it better to choose something super recent or just any example that stands out? Sorry if that’s too many questions—I’m a little nervous, but I’m definitely ready to start. Does that work?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to feel a bit nervous—this is a new muscle, and asking me to narrate the steps is a smart move. 
First, I’m locking to a real moment: “In Tuesday’s standup when we reviewed the release plan…” 
Next, I name only what a camera would catch: “while I was explaining the risk, you cut in mid-sentence and started assigning tasks to others.” 
Then, I own the impact on me: “I felt flustered and stopped; I lost my train of thought and later spent about 15 minutes clarifying in Slack.” 
Finally, I quick-scan for judgment leaks—swap words like “dismissive” for neutral verbs, and make sure each piece passes the camera test; what stands out to you in that pass?

**bailey_SBI:**

What stood out to me was how concrete each piece was. The “Tuesday’s standup…” anchored it to one moment, and the behavior felt very camera-testable—“cut in mid-sentence and started assigning tasks.” And the impact had both the feeling (“I felt flustered”) and a tangible consequence (the 15 minutes in Slack).

I’m still not totally sure how to spot judgment in the moment. Is “cut in mid-sentence” considered neutral enough, or is that edging into judgment like “interrupted”? Also, is it good to include that specific “15 minutes” detail, or could that come off as nitpicky? If I don’t know the exact time, is it okay to say “about 15 minutes” or “we spent extra time”?

One more tiny thing—do you literally want “I felt…” wording, like you used, or is “It made me feel flustered” acceptable? Sorry for all the questions—I think I’m following, I just want to make sure I’m not accidentally slipping in judgment-y words. Am I on the right track with what I noticed?

**MentorAI:**

You’re on the right track—the concreteness you noticed is exactly the muscle we’re building, and it’s normal to worry about judgment sneaking in. Quick check on that: between “you interrupted me” and “you cut in mid-sentence,” which one better passes the camera test—and what tips you off?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think… maybe “you interrupted me” passes the camera test better? My thinking is you could, like, see and count an interruption on a recording, whereas “cut in mid-sentence” sounds a bit interpretive to me—like I’m assuming I wasn’t about to finish. But I’m honestly not confident—“interrupted” also feels like a label that could be judgment-y.

Would something clunkier like “you started speaking while I was still talking” be more camera-testable? I can’t tell if I’m inventing problems here. Could you sanity-check which one actually fits the camera test better and what the tell is? Sorry if I’m overthinking it.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—this is the slippery part, and checking the words is exactly right. Of your options, “you started speaking while I was still talking” is the most camera-testable; “interrupted” is a label that can carry judgment, and “cut in mid-sentence” works only if it’s literally mid-phrase. Heuristic: verbs over labels, and anchor to something a neutral observer could timestamp without guessing intention. Ready to try your own—pick a recent, specific moment and give me a full pass (moment, behavior, your owned impact) in one go.

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, here goes a full pass:

- Moment: In… I think it was yesterday’s standup? Or it might’ve been the planning sync late last week—when we were reviewing the ticket priorities.

- Behavior: While I was explaining the context for two of the tickets, you started speaking while I was still talking—like kind of talked over me and seemed pretty impatient, like you’d already decided the plan.

- Impact: I guess it made things feel a bit off, and I sort of lost my place a little—maybe not a huge deal, but it kind of threw the flow of the conversation.

I’m not sure if that’s too vague or too harsh in places. Do you want me to lock to just one of those meetings? And is “talked over me” too judgment-y compared to “started speaking while I was still talking”? Sorry if I messed that up—does this roughly follow the steps?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not messing this up—you hit the structure and your instincts about “talked over me” vs. “started speaking while I was still talking” show you’re watching for judgment, which is the hard part. Before I weigh in, predict this for me: if I were to push on one part of your draft, which exact phrase would you flag as either not anchored enough or carrying judgment?

**bailey_SBI:**

My guess is you’d push on a few spots:

- “I think it was yesterday’s standup? Or… late last week” — that feels not anchored enough.
- “talked over me” — sounds like a label.
- “seemed pretty impatient” — judgment creeping in.
- “like you’d already decided the plan” — that’s me guessing intent.

And maybe even “started speaking while I was still talking” could be a little loaded? It seems okay, but I can’t tell if I’m nitpicking.

If I’m over-flagging, which exact one would you have me fix first? Sorry, I’m still calibrating my ear—am I close?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not over-flagging—you spotted the right leaks, and that’s a good sign. Fix the foundation first: lock the situation to one recognizable moment; pick the meeting you remember best and name it in one clear clause (e.g., “in yesterday’s standup right after we switched to ticket priorities”). Rewrite just your moment line to that single anchor.

**bailey_SBI:**

Would one of these work better?

- In yesterday’s standup, right after we switched to ticket priorities.
- In last Thursday’s planning sync, when we reviewed the ticket list.

I think the standup is fresher in my mind, but the planning sync might have been the one that actually bugged me more. Which would you want me to anchor to? Also, is that level of detail right, or do you want more (like time of day)? Sorry—I can commit to one if you’d prefer.

**MentorAI:**

You’re doing exactly what strong feedback-givers do—pick a real moment and make it findable. Go with the one that’s most vivid to you and recognizable to them; “In yesterday’s standup, right after we switched to ticket priorities” is the right level of detail—no time of day needed unless there were multiple standups that day. Lock that in and give me your full draft again with only that anchor changed; keep the behavior and impact as you wrote them for now.

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, here’s the full draft with the moment locked:

- Moment: In yesterday’s standup, right after we switched to ticket priorities.
- Behavior: While I was explaining the context for two of the tickets, you started speaking while I was still talking—like kind of talked over me and seemed pretty impatient, like you’d already decided the plan.
- Impact: I guess it made things feel a bit off, and I sort of lost my place a little—maybe not a huge deal, but it kind of threw the flow of the conversation.

Does that match what you meant by locking the moment? I can tweak the anchor if I missed something.

**MentorAI:**

Your anchor is nailed—that’s a clear, findable moment. Now zero in on the behavior: run the camera test and rewrite it as one sentence using only what a recorder would capture (verbs and specifics, no labels or intent-reading)—what’s your revised behavior line?

**bailey_SBI:**

How about: While I was explaining the context, you started speaking while I was still talking and assigned tasks to Alex and Priya, continuing for about 20 seconds while I went quiet, kind of talking over me and sounding impatient.

I tried to stick to verbs, but I’m worried “talking over me” and “sounding impatient” are still judgment-y—should I strip those?

**MentorAI:**

Good catch—that’s exactly where judgment sneaks in; “talking over me” and “sounding impatient” are labels, not lenses. Try a clean behavior line that only a mic/camera would capture: overlapping speech, assigning tasks to Alex and Priya, and ~20 seconds where you went quiet—skip tone words. What’s your one-sentence rewrite?

**bailey_SBI:**

While I was explaining the context for two tickets, you began speaking at the same time and assigned tasks to Alex and Priya, and for about 20 seconds I stopped speaking while you continued.

Does that hit the camera test cleanly, or is it too stiff/too detailed? I can trim or adjust if needed.

**MentorAI:**

That line passes the camera test—clear and neutral 👍 Now tighten the impact: name your actual felt response (pick one word you’d own) and one concrete consequence you experienced, without hedging—what’s your one-sentence impact?

**bailey_SBI:**

I guess I felt a little flustered, and it kind of threw me off and I ended up sending some extra Slack messages later to clear things up.

Is that too soft? Should I be more direct or name a specific amount of time there?

**MentorAI:**

You’re close—the softness is coming from the hedges (“I guess,” “a little,” “kind of,” “some”), which lots of people use to be polite; SBI lands better when you own it. Try this: pick one word that truly fits what you felt in that moment, drop the hedges, and name one concrete consequence you experienced (a rough time estimate or a countable action). Put that into one sentence—what’s your revised impact?

**bailey_SBI:**

I felt frustrated and embarrassed, and I spent about 15 minutes after the meeting drafting three Slack messages and recording a quick Loom to clarify the risk.

Is that too much—should I stick to just one feeling and one consequence? Happy to tighten it.

**MentorAI:**

Not too much—the consequence detail is useful, and both feelings can be true. For a crisper delivery, pick one primary feeling and one concrete consequence; “about 15 minutes” is perfectly fine. Which single feeling best captures what you felt in the moment?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think “frustrated” fits best.

Part of me wants to say “embarrassed,” but the main thing I felt in that moment was frustrated when I lost my place and had to fix it after. Is “frustrated” okay to use in a feedback conversation, or would “flustered” land better? Just checking I’m not making it sound blame-y.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fine to use “frustrated”—owned feelings aren’t blame; blame creeps in through judged behavior or guessed intent, not “I felt…”. “Flustered” reads softer; pick the one that’s truest to the moment. Go ahead and write your one-sentence impact using “frustrated” and one concrete consequence you experienced.

**bailey_SBI:**

I felt a little frustrated, and I spent about 15 minutes after the meeting drafting a Slack message to clarify the risk.

Should I drop “a little” to make it cleaner, or does that help it land less harsh?

**MentorAI:**

Drop “a little.” Hedges make your ownership fuzzy; “I felt frustrated…” is clear and not harsher, and the proportion shows through the consequence (“about 15 minutes”). Now stitch your final SBI into one tight pass using your current moment, the camera-test behavior, and the unhedged impact, and share it here.

**bailey_SBI:**

In yesterday’s standup, right after we switched to ticket priorities, while I was explaining the context for two tickets, you began speaking at the same time and assigned tasks to Alex and Priya; I stopped speaking for about 20 seconds while you continued. I felt frustrated, and I spent about 15 minutes after the meeting drafting a Slack message to clarify the risk. It felt a bit dismissive.

Does that land the way you intended, or did I just let judgment creep back in at the end? Happy to tighten it.

**MentorAI:**

You’re very close—the anchor and camera-test behavior land cleanly. Can you drop the last line (“It felt a bit dismissive”—that’s judgment creeping back in) and share your tightened two-sentence version?

**bailey_SBI:**

In yesterday’s standup, right after we switched to ticket priorities, while I was explaining the context for two tickets, you began speaking at the same time and assigned tasks to Alex and Priya, and I stopped speaking for about 20 seconds while you continued. I felt frustrated, and I spent about 15 minutes after the meeting drafting a Slack message to clarify the risk.

Does that read clean, or should I tighten any wording?

**MentorAI:**

That lands—let’s take it as your first success and move to a higher‑stakes variation. New scenario: in last Thursday’s client status call on Zoom, your manager (Sam) jumped in while you were explaining a risk and committed to a Friday delivery in front of the client. Give me a full pass—moment, camera-test behavior, and your owned impact—in one go.

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, full pass:

- Moment: In last Thursday’s client status call on Zoom—well, I’m pretty sure it was Thursday’s—when we were going over the risk on the timeline.

- Behavior: While I was explaining the risk, Sam jumped in and basically cut me off and committed to a Friday delivery in front of the client, kind of overriding what I was trying to say and making it sound like the risk wasn’t a big deal.

- Impact: I guess it made things feel a bit off—like I got a little flustered and not super confident continuing—and it probably created some extra back-and-forth later.

Does this roughly follow the steps? I can tighten the moment if you want me to name it more precisely, and I’m worried “cut me off/overriding” is too judgment-y—should I swap those for something more neutral?

**MentorAI:**

You’re tracking the right concerns; let’s tighten one thing first. The moment isn’t anchored—“I’m pretty sure” undermines it. Lock it to a single, findable moment with no hedging and reshare your full pass; we’ll look at the wording of the behavior next. What’s your revised draft with a clean anchor?

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the full pass with a locked anchor:

- Moment: In last Thursday’s client status call on Zoom, around 10:02 a.m., right after we moved from the timeline slide to the risk discussion.
- Behavior: While I was explaining the risk, Sam started speaking while I was still talking and told the client, “We can commit to Friday,” and I went quiet for about 15–20 seconds; it kind of overrode what I was trying to say and made the risk seem not that serious.
- Impact: I felt a little flustered, and I think I spent maybe 20–30 minutes after the call drafting messages to clarify.

Is that anchored clearly enough, or did I overdo the detail on the moment? I know the behavior line still has some judgment-y bits—I can clean those next.

**MentorAI:**

Your anchor is solid—time-of-day isn’t needed, but it doesn’t hurt. The gap is in the behavior: everything up to “…told the client, ‘We can commit to Friday,’ and I went quiet for about 15–20 seconds” passes the camera test; the rest (“overrode…made the risk seem not that serious”) is interpretation. Suggestion: cut that clause and keep only overlapping speech, the exact quote, and you going quiet, then reshare your full pass with just that behavior line tightened. Can you make that revision now?

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the full pass with only the behavior line tightened:

- Moment: In last Thursday’s client status call on Zoom, around 10:02 a.m., right after we moved from the timeline slide to the risk discussion.
- Behavior: While I was explaining the risk, Sam started speaking while I was still talking and told the client, “We can commit to Friday,” and I went quiet for about 15–20 seconds.
- Impact: I felt a little flustered, and I think I spent maybe 20–30 minutes after the call drafting messages to clarify.

Does that behavior line pass the camera test cleanly, or should I tweak any wording?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—the behavior line passes the camera test cleanly, and the anchor is clear enough. The gap is the impact: it’s hedged (“a little,” “I think,” “maybe”). Own one feeling and one concrete consequence in one sentence, no hedges. Give me your revised full pass with just the impact tightened.

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the full pass with just the impact tightened:

- Moment: In last Thursday’s client status call on Zoom, around 10:02 a.m., right after we moved from the timeline slide to the risk discussion.
- Behavior: While I was explaining the risk, Sam started speaking while I was still talking and told the client, “We can commit to Friday,” and I went quiet for about 15–20 seconds.
- Impact: I felt a little frustrated, and I think I spent maybe 20 minutes after the call drafting a follow-up Slack message to clarify the risk.

Is that closer to what you’re looking for, or should I make it crisper?

**MentorAI:**

Anchor and behavior are solid. The miss is in the impact—hedges like “a little,” “I think,” and “maybe” blunt your ownership; swap them for owned language and a concrete consequence (e.g., “about 20 minutes”). Tighten just that line and share your full pass again—can you post the revised version?

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the full pass with just the impact tightened:

- Moment: In last Thursday’s client status call on Zoom, around 10:02 a.m., right after we moved from the timeline slide to the risk discussion.
- Behavior: While I was explaining the risk, Sam started speaking while I was still talking and told the client, “We can commit to Friday,” and I went quiet for about 15–20 seconds.
- Impact: I felt frustrated, and I spent about 20 minutes after the call drafting a follow-up Slack message to clarify the risk.

Does this read tighter and owned enough, or would you tweak any wording?

**MentorAI:**

This meets the bar: clear anchor, camera-test behavior, and owned impact—nice work. If you want brevity, you can drop the “around 10:02 a.m.” without losing clarity; otherwise I wouldn’t tweak it. Looking back, what’s the one principle you’ll carry forward when giving SBI feedback under pressure?
