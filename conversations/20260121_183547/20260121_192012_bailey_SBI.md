**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI. Success means you anchor to a specific moment, describe observable behavior (no judgments), state the impact in owned language, and can notice when judgment leaks in. I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll get you drafting—ready to start?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—ready! A demo would really help. I tend to blur what I saw with what I think it meant, so if you can point out how you keep it clean, that would be great. Also, when you say “owned language,” do you mean I should literally start with “I felt…” or is “It made me feel…” okay? And if I start slipping into judgment when it’s my turn, can you flag it? Sorry for the extra questions—I just want to make sure I’m doing this the right way.

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to blur observation with interpretation—this bit trips a lot of people up, and we’ll keep it clean together. And yes, I’ll flag any judgmenty phrasing as you draft. Here’s a quick demo, thinking out loud:

1) Pick a specific moment: Tuesday’s standup, right after ticket triage, when I started my update.
2) Describe only what a camera would show: you were typing on your laptop, didn’t look up, and spoke over me twice. I almost wrote “you weren’t paying attention,” but that’s a motive read, so I swapped it for the observable “didn’t look up.”
3) Name the impact in owned language: I felt rushed and a bit dismissed, and I lost my place and skipped two points. On phrasing: “I felt…” is cleanest; “It made me feel…” can work, but it subtly assigns blame—use it sparingly.
4) Quick self-checks I run: camera test (no mind-reading), feeling-not-judgment (swap “unprofessional/disrespectful” for an emotion or concrete consequence), motive deletion (remove “because” stories).
5) Put it together: In Tuesday’s standup after triage, when I started my update, you kept typing, didn’t look up, and spoke over me twice. I felt rushed and a bit dismissed, and I lost my place and skipped two points.

Ready to try your own full draft of all three parts?

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, I can try. Here’s a first pass, but I’m not super confident I picked the right moment:

- Situation: In one of our recent standups—maybe Tuesday? Or it could’ve been Thursday—right after we finished going through the bugs and I started my update on the API tests.

- Behavior: You were typing on your laptop and I think you talked over me a couple of times. It kind of felt like you were impatient and not really willing to hear me out, like you had already decided it wasn’t that important.

- Impact: It kind of made the vibe a bit off, and I guess I maybe sped up and skipped some details. Not a huge deal or anything, but it just wasn’t great.

Is this in the ballpark, or is it too harsh in places and too vague in others? I’m guessing “impatient/not willing to hear me out” is me mind-reading. Also, is “talked over me” already too judgmenty? Sorry—should I lock onto a specific day, or is this okay for practicing? Could you point out what you’d fix first?

**MentorAI:**

You’re in the ballpark, and it’s totally normal to feel wobbly on the moment—this part is genuinely tricky. Before I weigh in, could you run the self-check you saw (camera test, motive deletion, feeling-not-judgment), anchor it to one standup you can picture, and tell me what you’d change?

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, I’ll run the self-check and try to lock onto one moment:

- Anchor to one standup: I think it was Tuesday’s standup, right after triage, when I started my API tests update. I can picture being halfway through the second bullet. I’m 80% sure it was Tuesday—does it matter if I’m off by a day for practice, or do you want me to be exact?

- Camera test: What a camera would show: you were typing on your laptop, your eyes stayed on the screen, and we ended up talking at the same time twice. Is “didn’t look up” okay to include, or is that too nitpicky? Also, is “spoke over me” too loaded—should I say “we overlapped” instead?

- Motive deletion: I’m removing “impatient/not willing to hear me out.” I think that was me guessing intent. I can’t tell if “spoke over me” still implies motive, so I’d love your read.

- Feeling-not-judgment: For impact, my instinct is to say: “It made me feel a bit rushed, and I lost my place and skipped two points.” Part of me wants to add “and I got the sense my update wasn’t a priority,” but that sounds like interpretation again. Also, is “rushed” a feeling or more like a state? Would “I felt dismissed” be too strong?

Proposed revision (still a little wobbly):
- In Tuesday’s standup after triage (I think), when I started my API tests update, you kept typing, didn’t look up, and we were talking at the same time twice. It made me feel a bit rushed, I lost my place, and I skipped a couple points. I also got the sense my update wasn’t that important.

Could you flag what I should fix first? I’m worried I overcorrected some parts and maybe invented problems (like whether “twice” sounds accusatory).

**MentorAI:**

You’re doing the right kind of scrutiny—this is exactly the muscle we’re building, and a recognizable moment (like Tuesday’s standup after triage) is enough. Your behavior line is camera-clean, and “twice” helps anchor it. The one place I’d focus now is impact: use owned language and drop the “not important” interpretation.

Could you rewrite just your impact starting with “I felt …” and include one emotion (e.g., rushed or dismissed) plus the concrete consequence (lost my place, skipped two points), leaving out the priority inference?

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, trying just the impact:

I felt a bit rushed and kind of dismissed, and I lost my place and skipped two points.

Is that too much? Do you want me to stick to just one emotion? If so, I can make it “I felt a bit rushed, and I lost my place and skipped two points.” Or is “dismissed” actually closer to what this should be? Sorry—I’m not sure which lands better.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overdoing it—picking the truest word matters because it sets the tone. Which one matches what you actually felt in that moment (the one you can say out loud without flinching)—rushed or dismissed—and will you use it to post your full draft now?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think “rushed” is the one I can say without flinching. Here’s my full draft:

- Situation: In Tuesday’s standup after triage, when I started my API tests update (about halfway through my second bullet).
- Behavior: You kept typing on your laptop, didn’t look up, and we were talking at the same time twice.
- Impact: I felt rushed, and I lost my place and skipped two points.

Does this land cleanly? Is “we were talking at the same time” better than “spoke over me” here, or would you keep the original phrasing? And is “didn’t look up” useful or too nitpicky? Happy to tighten anything—I’m still a little worried I’m missing a judgment leak somewhere.

**MentorAI:**

This is close, and I hear the caution—you’ve kept it steady without softening it into mush. Before I weigh in, where do you predict I’d push first in your draft, and why?

**bailey_SBI:**

My best guess is you’d push first on “we were talking at the same time twice.” I softened it because “spoke over me” felt harsh, but I think your point in the demo was that “spoke over me twice” is still camera-clean and more precise. So you might nudge me to use that wording so I’m not smoothing it into vagueness.

Second guess would be trimming the Situation—maybe dropping “(about halfway through my second bullet)” because it doesn’t add much.

I’m less sure about “didn’t look up”: part of me worries it’s nitpicky, but you modeled it as a clean substitute for “not paying attention,” so maybe that’s fine.

Does that match where you’d push, or am I hunting for issues that aren’t really there?

**MentorAI:**

Your prediction matches mine: the overlap phrasing is the only real tweak, and trimming the “halfway through my second bullet” is optional—this draft meets the bar. Ready for a higher‑stakes variation? Try this: in Thursday’s cross‑team review with product and QA on the call, as you started your API tests update, your manager kept typing, didn’t look up, and cut in twice to pivot to release timing—draft your full SBI for that.

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, here’s a first pass—this one feels a bit higher-stakes so I might be off:

- Situation: In Thursday’s cross‑team review with product and QA on the call, when I started my API tests update—right after the dashboard slide, I think? Or basically at the start of my section.

- Behavior: You kept typing, didn’t look up, and cut in twice to pivot to release timing. It felt like you were prioritizing release over quality and kind of shutting down my update.

- Impact: It made things feel a bit off and rushed, and I think I sped up and probably skipped some context/details. Not a huge deal, but it wasn’t great.

Is this too harsh in the behavior line? Is “cut in” or “prioritizing release over quality” too judgmenty? Also, since it’s my manager, should I say “you” or “my manager” when I actually deliver it? Happy to revise—could you point out what you’d change first?

**MentorAI:**

Higher stakes tend to pull in interpretation—totally normal, and you’re right to check it. The first fix: your behavior line leaks motive in “felt like you were prioritizing release over quality and shutting down my update.” Drop that clause and keep only what a camera would show—kept typing, didn’t look up, and cut in twice to shift to release timing. Can you post a revised full draft with just that change?

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the revised full draft with just that change:

- Situation: In Thursday’s cross‑team review with product and QA on the call, when I started my API tests update—right after the dashboard slide, I think? Or basically at the start of my section.
- Behavior: You kept typing, didn’t look up, and cut in twice to shift to release timing.
- Impact: It made things feel a bit off and rushed, and I think I sped up and probably skipped some context/details. Not a huge deal, but it wasn’t great.

Does this match what you were looking for? Is “cut in” camera‑clean enough here, or should I say “spoke over me twice”? And do you want me to switch the impact to “I felt…” in the next pass, or keep it as is for now? Also, when delivering this to my manager, would you still use “you,” or name the behavior without “you” to soften it?

**MentorAI:**

You anchored the moment and kept the behavior camera‑clean—nice. The gap is the impact: “It made things feel…” plus “I think/probably” isn’t owned. Swap to “I felt …” and name the concrete consequence (drop the hedging). “Cut in” is fine; “interrupted me twice to talk about release timing” or “spoke over me twice” are also camera‑clean—pick what matches your memory. And when delivering to your manager, use “you.”

Will you revise the impact into owned language and post your full draft?

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s my full draft with the impact revised:

- Situation: In Thursday’s cross‑team review with product and QA on the call, when I started my API tests update (right after the dashboard slide).
- Behavior: You kept typing, didn’t look up, and interrupted me twice to talk about release timing.
- Impact: I felt a bit rushed and kind of self‑conscious, and I lost my place and skipped two points.

Is this closer? Do you want me to stick to just one emotion—maybe just “rushed”—and remove the “a bit/kind of” hedges? Also, is “interrupted me twice” better than “cut in twice,” or are they basically interchangeable here? Sorry—I’m trying to keep it clean without sounding too sharp.

**MentorAI:**

This lands cleanly—you’ve met the bar even in a higher‑stakes setting 👍. Your moment is specific, the behavior is camera‑clean (“didn’t look up” and “interrupted me twice” both work), and the impact is owned. If you want to tighten tone, drop the hedges (“a bit/kind of”) and pick the single truest emotion; otherwise you can deliver this as‑is.

What rule of thumb from this will you carry into your next feedback conversation?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think my rule of thumb will be: camera, then feeling-plus-consequence.

- Say only what a camera would show (no motive reads), then
- Start impact with “I felt [one true emotion], and [concrete consequence].”

I can add “delete any because/motive stories” as a quick self-check. Does that feel like the right thing to prioritize, or should I be focusing more on anchoring the exact moment first? I’m pretty sure this is what helped me get cleaner, but I don’t want to be missing the mark.

**MentorAI:**

Your rule of thumb is solid—keep “camera, then feeling+consequence” as the core. Add one quick pre‑step: anchor a recognizable moment in a single clause (“In Thursday’s review when I started my update…”), then run your motive‑deletion check. That three‑beat checklist will keep you clean even under pressure. Want to lock that in as your go‑to?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—happy to lock that in as my go‑to. My version of the three‑beat checklist (plus a quick check) would be:

- Anchor: “In [recognizable moment] when I started my update…”
- Camera: describe only what a camera would show.
- Feeling + consequence: “I felt [one true emotion], and I [concrete consequence].”
- Quick motive‑deletion check: remove any “because/priority” or mind‑reading.

Does that match what you meant? And for the emotion piece, if I freeze, is there a short go‑to set you recommend (e.g., rushed, dismissed, frustrated), or should I just pick the closest one I can say without flinching?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—your checklist matches exactly. If you freeze on the emotion, pick the closest word you can say without flinching and pair it with the concrete consequence; one word is plenty, no hedges. Handy pocket set: rushed, frustrated, anxious, discouraged, distracted; or a physical cue if that’s truer—tense/tight, knot in my stomach.

Which one or two of those will you put on your card as your defaults under pressure?

**bailey_SBI:**

I’ll put “rushed” as my primary default, and “anxious” as my backup. Those are both words I can say without flinching.

If it helps, I might jot a tiny physical cue in the corner—“knot in my stomach”—for when I blank. Does that seem like the right pairing, or would you steer me toward “frustrated” instead in some cases?

**MentorAI:**

“Rushed” with “anxious” as backup plus that “knot in my stomach” cue is a solid pairing. I’d use “frustrated” when the felt sense is irritation or blocked energy—e.g., repeated interruptions or something preventing progress—otherwise stick with the truest word you can say cleanly. One word is enough; don’t hedge.

Quick look back: what felt hardest in this, and what’s the single phrase you’ll keep on your card to keep yourself clean under pressure?

**bailey_SBI:**

Hardest: honestly, owning the impact without hedging—saying “I felt [one word]” out loud and stopping myself from softening it.

Card phrase: “Camera, then I felt + consequence.”

Does that work as my pressure cue, or would you tighten it even more?

**MentorAI:**

Your cue works; if you want it even crisper under pressure, use: “Anchor. Camera. I felt + consequence.” Add a quiet rider to yourself—“one true word, no hedges.” That’s your growth edge and the thing that steadies the whole message 👍

**bailey_SBI:**

Got it—I’ll put on my card:
- Anchor. Camera. I felt + consequence.
- Rider: one true word, no hedges.

I can stick that on my monitor. Would it make sense to do one super-quick lightning rep to test it, or give me a 2‑minute homework drill (like two past moments to write out with that cue)? I just want to make sure I can execute it without overthinking when it’s live. Does that sound like the right next step?

**MentorAI:**

That’s a perfect next step. Do this 2‑minute drill to lock it in:
- Set a 2‑minute timer.
- Pick two real moments from the last week.
- For each, write one sentence: “In [recognizable moment] … you [camera behavior]. I felt [one true word], and I [consequence].”
- Cross out any motive/because/priority language and delete hedges.
- Read it once out loud; if you flinch, swap in a truer emotion or tighten the behavior.

When you’re done, drop one rep here for a quick spot‑check.

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s one rep from the last week:

In Thursday’s review with product and QA, when I started my API tests update—maybe right after the dashboard slide—you kept typing, didn’t look up, and seemed checked out; it made me feel a bit rushed, and I probably lost my place and skipped two points.

Is that close, or did I undo the clean bits? I’m guessing “seemed checked out” and the “maybe/it made me feel a bit/probably” are the parts to cut—should I swap “seemed checked out” for nothing, or name something camera‑clean instead? Happy to tighten based on your spot‑check.

**MentorAI:**

You spotted the right leaks—“seemed checked out” and the hedges (“maybe/a bit/probably”). Cut those and keep only what the camera shows; don’t replace them with a motive guess. A tight version of your line would be: In Thursday’s review with product and QA, when I started my API tests update right after the dashboard slide, you kept typing and didn’t look up; I felt rushed, and I lost my place and skipped two points.

Will you post your tightened one-liner now (no hedges, no motive reads)?

**bailey_SBI:**

In Thursday’s review with product and QA, when I started my API tests update right after the dashboard slide, you kept typing and didn’t look up; I felt a bit rushed, and I lost my place and skipped two points.

Is that tight enough, or should I drop “a bit” to keep it sharper? I think it’s clean on motive reads, but can you sanity‑check me?

**MentorAI:**

Clean on motive reads. Drop “a bit” to keep it crisp; everything else lands. Will you say the tightened version out loud once and tell me if any word makes you flinch?

**bailey_SBI:**

“In Thursday’s review with product and QA, when I started my API tests update right after the dashboard slide, you kept typing and didn’t look up; I felt rushed, and I lost my place and skipped two points.”

Saying it out loud, I flinched a bit at “didn’t look up” and at “I felt rushed.” Is that normal? Would you keep both as-is for a real conversation, or would you tweak either of those for tone?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to flinch here—naming impact plainly can feel exposed. If “didn’t look up” feels sharp, try “kept your eyes on the screen” (still camera‑clean); if “I felt rushed” snags, “I felt hurried” is a gentler, honest equivalent. Keep the tone steady rather than adding hedges. Try your line with the micro‑swap you prefer out loud once, then post the version you can say without flinching.

**bailey_SBI:**

Said out loud once—this version felt steady:

In Thursday’s review with product and QA, when I started my API tests update right after the dashboard slide, you kept typing and kept your eyes on the screen; I felt hurried, and I lost my place and skipped two points.

Does that read clean to you too?

**MentorAI:**

Reads clean—anchored moment, camera behaviors, owned impact. It’s deliverable as‑is; the “eyes on the screen” and “hurried” swaps keep it steady 👍. What made this version easier to say without flinching—the word choices, or repeating your “Anchor. Camera. I felt + consequence.” cue?

**bailey_SBI:**

Honestly, both helped—but the word choices did most of the work. “Eyes on the screen” felt descriptive instead of accusatory, and “hurried” was true without snagging me. Repeating “Anchor. Camera. I felt + consequence.” kept me from tacking on hedges once I started talking.

Does that sound like the right balance? And quick check: if I try gentler swaps in the future, what’s the best test to make sure they’re still camera‑clean and not me softening into euphemism?

**MentorAI:**

That balance is right—choose the words you can say cleanly, then let your cue keep you from hedging. For gentler swaps, run this quick check:

- Silent‑video test: Would a mute recording show exactly what you’re saying?
- Bystander yes/no: Could a neutral colleague who was there say “that happened”?
- Opposite‑intent test: If their intent were the opposite, would your words still describe the same thing? If not, you’re in motive.
- Recipient echo: Could they plausibly reply, “Yes, I did X and Y,” even if they disagree with your impact?

Which two of these will you add to your card as your go‑to checks for softening without slipping into euphemism?

**bailey_SBI:**

I’ll add these two to my card:
- Silent‑video test: Would a mute recording show exactly what I’m saying?
- Recipient echo: Could they plausibly reply, “Yes, I did X and Y,” even if they disagree with my impact?

Those feel fastest for me in the moment. If you think “bystander yes/no” is a stronger second than “recipient echo” for speed, I can swap it—does that tradeoff make sense, or would you keep my pair as-is?

**MentorAI:**

Your pair is spot on for speed and usefulness—silent‑video checks description, recipient echo previews how deliverable it is. Bystander yes/no overlaps with silent‑video, so it adds less than the echo does; I’d keep your pair as‑is. Want to lock those two as your defaults?
