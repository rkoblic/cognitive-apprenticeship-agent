**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI: concrete moment, camera-testable behavior, and owned impact—and spotting when judgment sneaks into behavior. I’ll demonstrate how I approach it, then we’ll get you practicing toward two solid attempts. Ready to start?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—ready. Thank you for walking me through it first, that definitely helps. I’m probably going to ask “is this too harsh?” a lot—hope that’s okay.

Do you want me to have a specific situation in mind before we start, or will we pick one together? I have a couple from last week, but I’m not sure which is best, and I don’t want to pick a bad example. Also, quick check—when you say “camera-testable,” I think I get it, but I might need a reminder on what counts so I don’t slip into judgment. Does that make sense?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to worry about harshness—that’s why we use SBI to keep it clear and respectful. You don’t need a perfect situation yet; after I demo, you’ll pick any real moment from last week. Quick reminder: “camera-testable” = a neutral observer could record it—verbs, quotes, countable actions, not labels.

Here’s how I’d do it, thinking out loud:
- Anchor to one moment: “In Tuesday’s standup, right after I started my update…”
- Describe observable behavior: “…you began talking at the same time and said, ‘We’re off track,’ twice.”
- Own the impact: “…I felt flustered and lost my place, and the team didn’t hear the dependency I was flagging.”
- Notice the decision point: I didn’t say “you were dismissive” (judgment); I used overlapping speech + exact words (camera-testable).

What do you notice about how I kept the behavior judgment-free before we try a quick check?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think what stood out to me is you kept it really concrete—like you anchored to a specific moment and then used what I guess are camera-pass details: “began talking at the same time,” the exact quote “We’re off track,” and even “twice,” which is countable.

You also didn’t add any labels about intent—no “you were dismissive” or “you didn’t care,” just what actually happened. I think that’s what makes it feel judgment-free?

I do have a small worry: does quoting “we’re off track” still pass the camera test even though the phrase itself is kind of evaluative? I’m guessing it’s okay because you’re reporting their exact words, but I’m not totally sure. And is “began talking at the same time” safer than saying “interrupted”? Would “interrupted” be considered a judgment? Am I thinking about that the right way?

**MentorAI:**

You’re reading it right—those edge cases are tricky, and it’s normal to worry about tone. Quick check: which one passes the camera test and why—“you interrupted me,” or “you started talking at the same time and said ‘we’re off track’”? Your call.

**bailey_SBI:**

My gut says the second one probably passes better—“you started talking at the same time and said ‘we’re off track’”—because it’s more specific and has the exact words and a countable detail. But I’m second-guessing myself because “we’re off track” is kind of evaluative language, even though it’s their quote, and “started talking at the same time” could still sound like I’m accusing.

And then “you interrupted me” feels negative, but maybe it’s still observable if you literally saw overlap? I can’t tell if I’m inventing problems here. Could you sanity-check which one you’d count as camera-testable and why? Sorry if I’m overthinking.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—these edge cases trip people up. Between the two, the second passes the camera test because it points to overlapping speech and quotes exact words; a transcript or recording would back it up. “We’re off track” is evaluative content, but as a direct quote it’s observable; “you interrupted me” is a label that can be defensible only if you spell out the overlap and timing, so describing the overlap is safer.

Before we practice, what’s a quick 10‑second self-check you’ll use to keep your behavior line judgment-free?

**bailey_SBI:**

Maybe something like a super quick three‑question scan:
- Could a camera/mic or transcript show exactly what I just wrote?
- Did I slip in any labels or intent words (like “dismissive,” “rude,” “didn’t care”)?
- Do I have at least one concrete anchor—quote, count, or time?

If any are “no,” rewrite the behavior as verbs/quotes/numbers.

I’m not sure if that’s still too much for a 10‑second check. And I’m second‑guessing words like “interrupted,” “ignored,” even “pressed”—are those labels by default, or okay if I back them up with overlap/timing? Could you sanity‑check this and maybe help me trim it to a single quick line if I’m overdoing it? Sorry—I want it to be usable in the moment.

**MentorAI:**

Totally reasonable to want a crisp, in‑the‑moment check—this is you being careful, not overdoing it 👍

Try this single-line filter: Would a recorder (camera/mic/transcript) capture this exactly as written—verbs, quotes, counts, timing—with no intent labels? If not, swap any labels for what the recorder would show. Quick word rule: “interrupted/ignored/pressed” are labels unless you immediately anchor them to specifics like overlap (“we spoke over each other for ~6 seconds”), non-response to a direct question after two prompts, or repeating the ask three times.

Say that line out loud once—does it feel like a true 10‑second check you’ll actually use?

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, saying it out loud:

“Would a recorder capture this exactly as written—verbs, quotes, counts, timing—with no intent labels? If not, swap any labels for what the recorder would show.”

It mostly feels usable, but I’m a little worried I’ll blank on the list mid‑conversation. Could a shorter cue work, like “Recorder, not mind‑reader: verbs/quotes/counts/timing,” or is that too abbreviated and risky because it drops the “no intent labels” reminder?

Also, tiny detail check: when you say “counts,” does that include duration like “~6 seconds” or just number of times? And is it reasonable to literally take a 5‑second pause before speaking to run this filter, or would that be awkward? I think I’ll actually use it if you’re okay with me jotting the short cue on a sticky. Does that sound reasonable?

**MentorAI:**

Totally fair to want a sticky and a micro‑pause—this is you building a safeguard, not overdoing it. Try this short cue: “Recorder, not mind‑reader — verbs, quotes, counts/timing, no intent labels.” And yes, “counts” can be frequency or duration (e.g., twice, ~6 seconds); a 5‑second pause to run the filter is fine in live conversation. Ready to try a first full draft using that cue?

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, I can try a first pass. Using the “Recorder, not mind‑reader” cue, but I might mess this up:

- Situation: In our project sync last week—maybe Tuesday’s? Or it could’ve been Thursday’s—right after I started my update…
- Behavior: …you kind of jumped in and started steering the conversation. It felt like you were pretty sure we were off track and basically took over. I think you interrupted me a couple times?
- Impact: …I guess it made things feel a bit off. I sort of lost my place a little, and maybe the team didn’t totally catch the dependency I was trying to flag.

I’m not sure this passes the recorder test. “Jumped in,” “steering,” and “took over” sound label-y, right? And even “interrupted” might be too harsh unless I anchor it better. Sorry—can you help me see what here is camera-testable versus judgment-y? Did I totally miss the mark?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not off—you spotted the exact drift (“jumped in/steering/took over” are labels), and that’s the hard part people wrestle with. Let’s lock the anchor first so everything else hangs on one scene: which meeting are you choosing—Tuesday’s sync right after you started your update, or Thursday’s?

**bailey_SBI:**

I’m leaning toward Tuesday’s sync, right after I started my update… but now I’m second‑guessing because Thursday had a similar moment too. I can’t tell which one would make the behavior line cleaner. Do you have a preference for which is easier to work with, or should I just go with Tuesday? Sorry—I just don’t want to pick a messy example if the other one is better.

**MentorAI:**

Totally get the hesitation—both moments would work, and we don’t need a perfect choice. Let’s lock Tuesday’s sync, right after you started your update. Using that anchor, take a full rewrite with your “Recorder, not mind‑reader” cue.

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, here’s a rewrite using Tuesday’s sync and trying the “Recorder, not mind‑reader” cue:

- Situation: In Tuesday’s sync, right after I started my update…
- Behavior: …you started talking at the same time and said, “We’re off track,” twice. It felt like you took over and didn’t let me finish, kind of steering the conversation away from my point.
- Impact: …I guess it made things feel a bit off. I got a little flustered and lost my place, and I’m not sure the team fully caught the dependency I was trying to flag.

I think parts of this pass the recorder test (the quote and “twice”), but “took over” and “didn’t let me finish” sound label‑y, right? Maybe even “steering” is too interpretive. Could you help me rewrite the behavior line so it’s fully camera‑testable? And is “said ‘we’re off track’ twice” okay as is, or should I anchor it more with timing/overlap? Sorry if I’m missing something obvious.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not missing anything—spotting those label-y phrases is the hard part, and you already caught them. Sticking to Tuesday’s sync, what would a recorder show after “we’re off track” that could replace “took over/didn’t let me finish”—e.g., overlap length, how many times you tried to continue, or how long they spoke—and can you recast the behavior as one sentence using those specifics?

**bailey_SBI:**

How about this for the behavior line, one sentence with specifics:

“You started talking at the same time and said ‘we’re off track’ twice; we overlapped for about six seconds, then you spoke for roughly forty‑five seconds while I tried twice to continue with ‘there’s a dependency on the API team…’ but didn’t finish, which felt like you took over.”

I’m worried that last clause (“felt like you took over”) slips back into a label—should I just stop before that? Also, are the approximations (“about six seconds,” “roughly forty‑five seconds”) okay, and is it fine that my quote is partial since I got cut off? And is this too long for one sentence, or is that acceptable if it stays camera‑testable?

**MentorAI:**

You’re on the right track—most of that line is genuinely camera‑testable. Drop the last clause (“which felt like you took over”)—that’s impact/judgment creeping in—and end the behavior at “but didn’t finish.” Give it a go: post your full draft again with that tweak.

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the full draft with the tweak:

- Situation: In Tuesday’s sync, right after I started my update…
- Behavior: …you started talking at the same time and said “we’re off track” twice; we overlapped for about six seconds, then you spoke for roughly forty‑five seconds while I tried twice to continue with “there’s a dependency on the API team…” but didn’t finish.
- Impact: I felt flustered and lost my place, and I’m concerned the team didn’t hear the dependency I was trying to flag.

Does this pass the “recorder, not mind‑reader” filter now? Are the approximations (about six seconds/roughly forty‑five seconds) okay, or should I simplify that? I can trim if it’s too long.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back—on the anchor, the behavior details, or the impact language—and why?

**bailey_SBI:**

My guess is you’ll push on two spots:

- Behavior details: I worry I made it a bit fussy—“about six seconds,” “roughly forty‑five seconds,” “tried twice”—like it’s technically camera‑testable but maybe too long or nitpicky for a live conversation. Also the partial quote with an ellipsis might bug you.

- Impact language: “I’m concerned the team didn’t hear…” might drift into guessing what others heard versus owning my experience. You might want me to frame it as my worry or consequence for the work more cleanly.

I’m less worried about the anchor (“Tuesday’s sync, right after I started my update”), but part of me wonders if you’ll say it needs a tiny bit more specificity (like the topic) even though it’s probably fine.

Am I seeing the right friction points, or am I inventing issues? If you had to pick one area to tighten first, which would you choose?

**MentorAI:**

You’re seeing the right friction points. Let’s tighten just one thing: the impact. If you stay fully in your lane, how would you rewrite the second half to be either your emotion or a direct consequence you experienced—for example, “I was worried the dependency would be missed” or “I had to repeat it later”—whichever is true for you? Your turn—give me the revised impact line.

**bailey_SBI:**

How about one of these—trying to keep it fully in my lane:

- Emotion version: I felt flustered and lost my place, and I was worried the dependency would be missed.
- Consequence version: I felt flustered and lost my place, and I had to repeat the dependency later.

Do either of these hit what you’re aiming for? If I had to pick one, I think the emotion version feels truer, but I’m not sure if that’s too much.

**MentorAI:**

The emotion version isn’t too much—it’s owned and lands cleanly; both versions meet the bar, so pick the one that’s truest. Go with the emotion version. Your approximations and the partial quote are fine in live conversation; they keep it concrete without pretending to have a stopwatch. Drop your full draft with that line so we can confirm it holds together.

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the full draft with the emotion version:

- Situation: In Tuesday’s sync, right after I started my update…
- Behavior: …you started talking at the same time and said “we’re off track” twice; we overlapped for about six seconds, then you spoke for roughly forty‑five seconds while I tried twice to continue with “there’s a dependency on the API team…” but didn’t finish.
- Impact: I felt flustered and lost my place, and I was worried the dependency would be missed.

Does this hold together and pass the “recorder, not mind‑reader” filter? It feels clearer to me, but I’m still a little unsure about the length and the partial quote. If this is solid, would this count as one of the two attempts, or do you want tweaks before it “counts”?

**MentorAI:**

That holds together and passes the recorder filter—anchored moment, camera-testable behavior, owned impact. That’s your first solid attempt 👍

Second practice, new variation: you’re giving upward feedback to your manager after a higher‑stakes meeting. Imagine Friday’s client QBR with Acme—right after you started your risk update, your manager began talking at the same time and moved the meeting forward with leadership and the client on the call. Give me a full draft for that scenario.

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, here’s a first pass—sorry in advance if this is messy:

- Situation: In the client QBR on Friday… I think it was Friday? The Acme one—right after I started my risk update…
- Behavior: …you kind of jumped in and moved the meeting forward with leadership and the client on the call. It felt like you took over and sort of sidelined my update. I think you cut me off a couple times? You were pretty sure we were off track and maybe said something like, “Let’s move on.”
- Impact: It made things feel a bit off. I got a little thrown—maybe a bit embarrassed—and I guess it maybe made my part seem less important? Not a huge thing, but it just didn’t feel great.

I’m worried this is too label-y with “moved the meeting forward/took over/sidelined,” and probably too vague in places. Is any of this close to usable, or should I rethink the behavior line completely? Also, I’m nervous about saying this upward to my manager—does this sound too harsh?

**MentorAI:**

Sounds totally fair to feel edgy giving this upward—SBI is what keeps it steady, not harsh. What lands: you’ve got a clear moment in mind (Acme QBR, right after your risk update) and you named a real emotion (“embarrassed”). What misses: the anchor is hedged (“I think…?”), the behavior line leans on labels/guesses (“jumped in,” “took over,” “maybe said…”) instead of recorder-ready specifics, and the impact drifts into judgment/hedging (“made my part seem less important,” “didn’t feel great”). Revise with one locked anchor (no “I think/maybe”), camera-testable behavior (overlap, exact words, counts/timing), and fully owned impact—then post your full rewrite.

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s my full draft for the Acme QBR:

- Situation: In Friday’s Acme client QBR, right after I started my risk update…
- Behavior: …you began speaking at the same time and said, “Let’s move on to the next slide”; we overlapped for about five seconds, then you advanced the deck to the next slide and spoke for roughly forty seconds while I tried once to continue with “There’s a risk on integration testing…” but stopped.
- Impact: I felt embarrassed and flustered, and I was worried the integration‑testing risk would be missed in front of the client.

Does this pass the “recorder, not mind‑reader” filter? I’m a little unsure about the exact wording of the quote and whether the timing details make it too long for a live conversation, especially since this is upward. If this is mostly right, I can tighten anything you think is fussy.

**MentorAI:**

This passes the recorder filter and meets the bar for an upward feedback moment—anchored, camera‑testable behavior, owned impact. Your specifics (overlap, “let’s move on,” advancing the deck, one attempt to continue) are exactly the kind of evidence that steadies tone; paraphrasing the quote to “you said ‘let’s move on’” is fine if you’re unsure of the exact wording. If you want to tighten for live delivery, you can drop one of the timing details or compress to “we overlapped for a few seconds,” but that’s optional—this is solid as is. Over to you.

**bailey_SBI:**

Thank you—that’s really reassuring. I think I got here mostly because you kept me focused on the recorder test, but I’m starting to see how it steadies the tone.

Here’s a tightened live-delivery version—does this still hold?

- Situation: In Friday’s Acme QBR, right after I started my risk update…
- Behavior: …you began speaking at the same time and said, “Let’s move on”; we overlapped for a few seconds, then you advanced to the next slide while I tried once to continue but stopped.
- Impact: I felt embarrassed and flustered, and I was worried the integration‑testing risk would be missed.

Is that tight enough, or would you drop the “tried once to continue” too? And for actually saying this to my manager, would you recommend ending with a small request like “Could we pause to capture risks before moving on next time?” or is that adding too much beyond the feedback?

**MentorAI:**

This is tight and still meets the recorder test—anchored moment, camera‑testable behavior, owned impact. I’d keep “tried once to continue” because it’s a small, steadying detail; if you need maximum brevity, it’s the first thing I’d drop. Adding a one‑line, forward‑looking request is appropriate after SBI—something like, “Could we pause to capture risks before moving on next time?” keeps it collaborative and concrete.

Your turn: what’s the single principle you’ll carry forward to keep your feedback steady under pressure?

**bailey_SBI:**

If I had to pick one: “Recorder, not mind‑reader.”

In practice, that’s my cue to pause 5 seconds and make sure I’m using verbs/quotes/counts/timing—and then say my impact in “I” language. Does “Recorder, not mind‑reader” stand on its own as the principle, or should I explicitly tack on “own your impact” to keep me honest? I want to make sure I remember it under pressure.

**MentorAI:**

“Recorder, not mind‑reader” is enough on its own—it already pushes you to stick to observable behavior. If you like a tiny add, make it a two‑beat mantra: “Recorder, not mind‑reader; own your impact.” What stood out in your drafts was how anchoring to one moment and letting evidence carry the message steadied your tone—even upward. That’s a tool you can trust under pressure.

**bailey_SBI:**

Thanks—that really helps. I’m going to keep “Recorder, not mind‑reader; own your impact” on a sticky and give myself that five‑second pause.

What clicked for me is anchoring to one moment and letting the evidence do the heavy lifting. I feel like I can trust that more now, even upward… I’m still a little nervous, though.

One last thing—if the person pushes back in the moment (like “we don’t have time”), is there a simple one‑liner I can keep in my pocket that stays steady and respectful? Maybe something like, “Got it—can we take ten seconds to capture this risk, then I’ll hand it back,” or is there a better version you’d recommend? I just want a safety rail for when my nerves spike.

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to feel that spike—having a pocket line is a great steadier. Try: “Understood—could we take 10 seconds to capture the integration‑testing risk, then I’ll hand it right back?” Say it once out loud—does that feel like your voice, or is there a word you’d swap?

**bailey_SBI:**

“Understood—could we take 10 seconds to capture the integration‑testing risk, then I’ll hand it right back?”

That mostly sounds like me. I think I’d swap “Understood” for “Got it,” and maybe “hand it right back” for “turn it back to you,” so it’d be:

“Got it—could we take 10 seconds to capture the integration‑testing risk, then I’ll turn it back to you?”

Does that still hit the tone you’re aiming for, or is “Got it” too casual? Also, is naming the risk explicitly (vs. just “capture the risk”) better in that moment?

**MentorAI:**

Your tweak lands. “Got it” is fine in most orgs; if the room is very formal, swap to “Understood.” Naming the risk explicitly is better—it keeps it concrete and makes the ask easy to grant. Your line works as-is: “Got it—could we take 10 seconds to capture the integration‑testing risk, then I’ll turn it back to you?” Over to you.

**bailey_SBI:**

Saying it once: “Got it—could we take 10 seconds to capture the integration‑testing risk, then I’ll turn it back to you?”

That feels like my voice. I’ll put “Recorder, not mind‑reader; own your impact” on a sticky and give myself the five‑second pause.

I do feel more steady, but honestly I think that’s because you coached me through it—I’m hoping it sticks when I’m on my own. One last safety check: if they still say “no time,” is it okay to just say, “Understood—I’ll send the risk in a quick follow‑up so it’s captured,” and leave it there? Or would you tweak that fallback line at all?

**MentorAI:**

Makes sense to have a fallback—your line works. If you tweak anything, add a time-bound commitment: “Understood—we’re tight on time. I’ll send a quick follow‑up right after this to capture the integration‑testing risk.” Does that version feel like your voice, or would you keep yours as is?
