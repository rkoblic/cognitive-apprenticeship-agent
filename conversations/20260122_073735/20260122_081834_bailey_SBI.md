**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI: a real moment, an observable behavior, and your owned impact. Success is two solid attempts that meet those criteria—the first with support, the second on your own. I’ll model briefly to show how I think through it; ready to start?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—ready. It would really help to see your model first. Should I be thinking of a situation while you do that, or wait and pick one after? I sometimes overthink which example to choose and then it gets vague, so I just want to make sure I’m doing the right thing at the right time. And just to check—if I mess up a bit on the first try, that’s okay, right?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to overthink—this is a tricky skill, and your first try is for learning, so yes, some rough edges are expected. Watch the model first; then we’ll pick a real moment for you. Example I’d give a peer: “In Tuesday’s standup, when you interrupted me twice before I finished my update, I lost my train of thought and felt flustered, and I didn’t raise my blocker afterward.” I anchor to a single meeting, use a camera-visible action (“interrupted me twice”) instead of a judgment like “dismissive,” and I own the impact with my emotion plus a concrete consequence. Ready to choose a specific moment you want to use for your first attempt?

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, I think I have a few possibilities, but I’m not sure which one makes the most sense. There was yesterday’s project sync—well, I think it was yesterday, or maybe Monday—where Jordan kind of jumped in while I was giving my update. And then there was last week’s client prep when Sam came in late, like 10 minutes, I think? Also there was an email thread where Priya replied-all really quickly without much context and it caused a bit of back-and-forth.

Do any of those sound like a better fit for this? I’m leaning toward the meeting one, but I can’t tell if that’s too messy, or if the one-on-one prep session would be clearer. Which would you recommend I use?

**MentorAI:**

Totally fair to feel torn here—picking the moment is often the hardest part up front. Between Jordan jumping in during one specific update and Sam arriving ~10 minutes late to that client prep, which gives you a single, easy-to-picture moment and a clear felt impact for you—want to pick one of those now so we can draft it?

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay—maybe the Jordan one? It was in the project sync… I think yesterday? Or it might’ve been Monday… when they jumped in while I was giving my update. But I’m wondering if the Sam being late to the client prep (I want to say last Thursday? Or Wednesday?) is simpler.

I can’t tell which is easier to picture or gives a clearer impact. Would you recommend I stick with the Jordan meeting or go with the Sam-late one? Sorry—I know I’m waffling, I just don’t want to pick something that’s too messy.

**MentorAI:**

Totally get the wobble—this choice can feel high-stakes, but either will work and you don’t need the exact day; a recognizable meeting is enough. Let’s go with the Jordan project sync—it maps cleanly to the model and has a camera-visible behavior. Draft your full feedback for that moment in 1–3 sentences: anchor to that sync, name what you saw (the jump-in), and own your impact. Ready to give it a shot?

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, here’s a try: In the project sync—maybe yesterday or Monday—when I was sharing my update, you kind of jumped in and it felt like you’d already decided the direction and didn’t really let me finish. It sort of made the conversation feel a bit off, and I guess I lost my place a little and maybe that affected how I talked about the blocker.

Is that even close to what you’re looking for, or is it too judgmental/vague? Sorry if I’m missing the mark.

**MentorAI:**

You’re in the right shape—anchored to a meeting, naming what you saw, and owning some impact—and it’s totally normal to worry about judgment/vagueness here. Before I weigh in, if I were to push on one thing first, which specific phrase do you think I’d flag?

**bailey_SBI:**

A few things popped for me, and I’m not sure which you’d hit first. Maybe:

- “maybe yesterday or Monday” — that’s vague on the meeting
- “felt like you’d already decided the direction” — that sounds like I’m inferring intent
- “didn’t really let me finish” — also might imply intent?
- “sort of made the conversation feel a bit off” — that’s super soft on the impact

If I had to guess, maybe you’d flag “felt like you’d already decided the direction” first because it isn’t a camera-visible action? But I’m honestly not sure—can you tell me which one you’d prioritize? Sorry if I’m overthinking.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—you’re spotting the right risks, which is the work. Run this quick 3-part self-check on your draft:
- Moment: is it a single, recognizable meeting (e.g., “in Monday’s project sync”)?
- Behavior: camera-visible action (e.g., “jumped in twice while I was mid-sentence”), not intent or character?
- Impact: my emotion/physical state or a direct consequence for me?

Using that, what’s the first thing in your draft that fails the check?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think the first fail might be “maybe yesterday or Monday,” since that muddies the single, recognizable moment. But I’m not sure if that actually fails because I did say “the project sync,” which is a specific meeting.

If that still passes, then the next (and probably clearer) fail is “felt like you’d already decided the direction,” which reads as intent, not a camera-visible action.

Which one would you want me to fix first? Sorry—I can’t tell which you’d count as the earliest real miss.

**MentorAI:**

You’re reading this well. I’d prioritize the intent leak (“felt like you’d already decided the direction”)—that’s the biggest distortion. If you strip intent, what did Jordan actually do that a camera would catch—started talking while you were mid-sentence? once? twice? Update your 1–3 sentence draft using that camera-visible phrasing for the behavior; keep the rest as-is for now and share the full revision.

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, here’s the revision with the behavior switched to something camera-visible:

In the project sync—maybe yesterday or Monday—when I was sharing my update, you started talking while I was mid-sentence, I think twice. It sort of made the conversation feel a bit off, and I guess I lost my place a little and maybe that affected how I talked about the blocker.

Is that closer to what you meant, or did I still mess something up there?

**MentorAI:**

This is closer—switching to the camera-visible “started talking while I was mid-sentence” tightens it. To sharpen the impact, what did you actually experience in that moment that you can own—an emotion or a concrete consequence? Give me that in one short clause.

**bailey_SBI:**

Maybe: it sort of made the conversation feel a bit off. Is that the kind of clause you’re looking for, or is that too vague? Sorry—I’m trying not to overdo it.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overdoing it—“the conversation felt off” is a common go-to, and it stays vague. It doesn’t tell Jordan what happened for you. In that moment, which fits better: a specific emotion you felt (e.g., flustered) or a concrete consequence for you (e.g., I lost my place and didn’t raise the blocker)? Pick one and write just that short clause.

**bailey_SBI:**

I felt flustered.

Is that specific enough, or would the consequence be better?

**MentorAI:**

That works—“I felt flustered” is clear and owned. Go ahead and plug that into your draft by replacing the “conversation felt off” line, and share the full 1–3 sentence version so we can look at it together.

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the full version with the impact swapped:

In the project sync—maybe yesterday or Monday—when I was sharing my update, you started talking while I was mid-sentence, I think twice. I felt flustered, and I guess I lost my place a little and maybe that affected how I talked about the blocker.

Is that closer to what you’re looking for, or should I tighten the day and/or the “twice” part? Sorry if I’m still being too wobbly.

**MentorAI:**

You’re close—the core pieces are there, and a little wobble at this stage is normal. To lock the anchor, which single reference will you use—“yesterday’s project sync” or “Monday’s project sync”?

**bailey_SBI:**

Let’s go with “yesterday’s project sync”—does that work, or would you rather I say “Monday’s project sync”? I can switch if that’s clearer.

**MentorAI:**

“Yesterday’s project sync” works—recognizable and specific enough. Update your 1–3 sentence draft with that anchor and share the full version so we can look at it together.

**bailey_SBI:**

In yesterday’s project sync, when I was sharing my update, you started talking while I was mid-sentence—I think twice. I felt flustered and kind of lost my place, and I maybe didn’t explain my blocker as clearly.

Is that close to what you’re looking for, or should I firm up the “twice” and/or the impact wording?

**MentorAI:**

You’re on track. What made you include “I think twice”—what were you aiming to convey or achieve with that detail?

**bailey_SBI:**

I put “I think twice” because I wanted to show it wasn’t just a single moment—it happened more than once, which kind of explains why I lost my place—but I wasn’t totally sure on the exact number. Adding “I think” felt like a way to be honest and not overstate it, and also to soften it so it didn’t sound like I was accusing.

Is it better to name the count only if I’m totally sure? If I’m not, should I skip the number, or say something like “a couple of times”? I worry “a couple of times” is too fuzzy, but “twice” without “I think” feels risky if my memory’s off. What would you recommend here?

**MentorAI:**

Makes sense to want to be fair without over-claiming—good instinct. Rule of thumb: only name a count if you’re confident; otherwise say “more than once during my update” and drop hedges like “I think,” which invite debate. Pick either “twice” (if you’re sure) or “more than once,” plug it in, and share your full 1–3 sentence version.

**bailey_SBI:**

In yesterday’s project sync, while I was sharing my update, you started talking while I was mid-sentence more than once. I felt flustered and lost my place, and I didn’t explain my blocker as clearly.

Does that hit the mark, or would you tweak anything?

**MentorAI:**

That lands—clear moment, camera-visible behavior, and owned impact 👍. Now for a higher-stakes variation: imagine yesterday’s client status call on Zoom—while you were answering a timeline question, Jordan started talking over you more than once, with the client and your manager on the call. Write the 1–3 sentence feedback you’d give Jordan afterward, holding the same standards; send your full draft.

**bailey_SBI:**

In the client status call on Zoom—um, I think it was yesterday—while I was answering the timeline question, you kind of started talking over me a couple of times, and it felt like you wanted to steer the answer. It made things feel a bit awkward with the client and my manager on, and I guess I got a little thrown and maybe didn’t explain the timeline clearly.

Is that anywhere close, or is it too judgmental/vague?

**MentorAI:**

You’re very close—and it’s normal to worry about judgment here. One miss: “it felt like you wanted to steer the answer” is an intent inference, not observable—cut that. Revise and resend your 1–3 sentences with the anchored moment, the talking-over action, and your owned impact.

**bailey_SBI:**

In yesterday’s client status call on Zoom, while I was answering the timeline question, you started talking over me more than once, with the client and my manager on the call. I felt flustered and lost my train of thought, and I didn’t explain the timeline as clearly.

Does that meet the bar, or would you tweak anything?

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar—clear anchor, camera-visible behavior, and owned impact with a concrete consequence. It reads clean, direct, and usable as-is. What’s the single principle you’ll carry forward from this to make your next SBI easier?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think the single principle I’ll carry forward is: describe the behavior in camera-visible terms and cut any intent/character (“started talking over me more than once,” not “you wanted to steer”). That felt like the biggest unlock for me and makes the rest easier.

Does that sound like the right north star, or would you prioritize something else—like owning the impact? I can stick with one; just want to make sure I’m focusing on the right thing.

**MentorAI:**

That’s the right north star. Lead with camera-visible behavior, then tack on one owned impact in a short clause—keep cutting any intent language. You applied that cleanly in both drafts; trust it going forward. Sound good?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—that sounds good. So my quick checklist is: anchor to one recognizable moment, name a camera-visible action (no intent), then add one owned impact (either the emotion or the concrete consequence), and stop.

I’m still a little nervous I’ll slip back into “I think…” or start inferring intent in the moment—if I catch myself doing that, should I just pause and swap it for the literal action? And is it okay to open with a soft lead-in like “Can I share something from the call?” or should I go straight into the feedback?

Thanks—this really helped, but I’m still worried I’ll fumble without the prompts. Does this sound like the right way to practice?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to worry about slipping—catching yourself is a sign the skill’s landing, not failing. Here’s a quick rescue move for intent/hedges: pause, ask “What did a camera catch?”, say that as a simple verb phrase (“jumped in while I was mid-sentence”), then add one owned impact and stop. What exact rescue line will you use to prompt yourself in the moment—want to jot it now so it’s ready next time?

**bailey_SBI:**

How about: “Camera—what did I see/hear? Say the action; then one ‘I felt/I [consequence]’—stop.”

If that’s too wordy in the moment, a shorter version: “Camera action, then one impact—stop.”

Do either of those work, or would you tweak the wording so it sticks better when I’m flustered? I can write whichever one you think is clearer on a sticky note.

**MentorAI:**

Both are workable; when you’re flustered, shorter sticks. Try: “Camera: action; my impact—stop.” Write it big so your eyes land on it before you start talking. Will that version do the job on your sticky?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—I think “Camera: action; my impact—stop.” will work for me. I’ll write it big and put it on my monitor.

Would it help to make “STOP” in all caps so my brain actually pauses, or is that overkill? And do you recommend keeping it by my webcam so I see it right before I speak?

Thanks—this feels doable, but I’ll probably still need to remind myself a few times. Does that sound like a good setup?

**MentorAI:**

You’re setting yourself up well—visual cues really help when adrenaline spikes. Yes, make STOP in all caps and park the sticky right by your webcam so it’s in your eyeline as you start. A soft lead-in is fine—keep it short and neutral (“Can I share something from the call?”) and then go straight into camera action + your impact. What’s the next meeting where you’ll use this?
