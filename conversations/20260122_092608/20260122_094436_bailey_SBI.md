**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a real moment, describe camera-testable behavior, use owned impact language, and can spot when judgment creeps into behavior. I’ll demonstrate how I approach it first—ready to start?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—ready! I’m excited to learn this, and also a little nervous I’ll overthink it. Should I be thinking of a real situation while you demo, or wait until after? And is it okay if I pause you to ask quick clarifying questions as we go, just to make sure I’m tracking?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to feel a bit nervous—this is a new muscle, and overthinking is common; we’ll keep it simple. While I demo, hold your own situation for after, and yes, jump in with brief clarifying questions as we go. If that works, I’ll kick off a short demo now—good to go?

**bailey_SBI:**

Good to go! I’ll hold my situation for after and I’ll take a few quick notes. I might pause with a brief question if I get lost—hope that’s okay. One tiny ask: as you demo, will you name when you’re moving from the “when/where” part to the “what they did” and then the “how it affected you,” or do you want me to try to spot those on my own? Either way works—I just want to make sure I’m listening for the right things.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—I’ll explicitly flag the transitions as I demo and keep it tight.

- First, I anchor to a real moment so they can place it: “In yesterday’s design review when I walked through options B and C…”
- Now I move to what I saw—camera-testable, no labels: “…you had Slack open on your laptop and were typing during my walkthrough.” (I’m avoiding judgments like “that was disrespectful.”)
- Now I own the impact—my emotion or direct consequence: “I felt my focus splinter and started rushing; I skipped two points I’d planned to cover.”
- Quick self-check I run: specific moment? yes; behavior camera-testable? yes; impact owned (not a judgment)? yes.

What, if anything, would you like me to replay before we switch to your turn?

**bailey_SBI:**

That was super clear—thank you. A couple quick replays before we switch to my turn?

- Camera-testable vs judgment: could you sanity-check a few borderline words? Like “distracted,” “disengaged,” “unprepared,” or even “interrupted”—are any of those already judgments, or are some okay if phrased right?
- Impact wording: is it better to stick to “I felt X,” or is it fine to pair emotion plus consequence like you did (“I felt my focus splinter and I rushed…”)? And do I need to literally start with “I felt,” or is “I started rushing because I was nervous” acceptable?
- Situation specificity: how precise is “specific enough”? Is “yesterday’s design review” sufficient, or do you prefer something like “yesterday’s 2pm design review when I covered options B and C”?

Sorry if I’m overthinking—just want to make sure I’m aiming at the right level before I try it. Does that make sense?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—these are the right distinctions to care about 👍 Here’s a quick cheat-sheet you can use:

- Camera-testable vs judgment: “distracted/disengaged/unprepared” are judgments; swap to what you saw/heard (e.g., “looked at phone twice during the walkthrough,” “asked for the doc we’d sent last week”). “Interrupted” is borderline; safer is “you started talking while I was mid-sentence, and our voices overlapped.”
- Impact phrasing: Owned impact can be emotion, consequence, or both. It doesn’t have to start with “I felt,” as long as it’s yours: “I got tense and rushed,” “I felt frustrated and lost my place,” both work. Avoid “I felt it was unprofessional” (that’s a judgment in disguise).
- Situation specificity: Specific enough = they can locate the moment without guessing. If there was only one meeting, “yesterday’s design review” is fine; if there were multiple or it was long, add a cue like “at the 2pm review” or “when I covered options B and C.”
- Quick self-check: If a camera couldn’t capture it, it’s probably a judgment—rewrite it as something observable.

Ready to draft your full SBI for your real situation—all in one pass?

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, I’ll give it a shot—all in one pass:

In last week’s sprint planning—uh, I think Thursday afternoon? Or it might’ve been the Tuesday sync when I shared the dependency update—while I was walking through the timeline, you had Slack open and were typing, and then you jumped in while I was mid-sentence to ask if we could table it. It kind of came across like you were a bit checked out and had already decided it wasn’t that important. I guess it maybe made things feel a little off for me—I think I started kind of rushing and probably skipped some context, and it was a bit awkward?

Does that… sort of work? I’m not sure if I should pick Thursday or Tuesday—do you want me to lock one in? And can you check if “checked out” there is me slipping into judgment? Sorry if I bungled the balance; happy to rewrite it. Am I anywhere close?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not bungling this—there’s solid bones here, and that early uncertainty you’re feeling is totally normal. Before I weigh in, predict for me: if I were to push back on one part—specific moment, camera-testable behavior, or owned impact—where do you think it is, and why?

**bailey_SBI:**

If I have to pick one, I think you’d push back on the specific moment—since I hedged between Thursday’s planning and Tuesday’s sync, it isn’t anchored enough for them to know exactly when I mean.

I’m also worried I let judgment creep into behavior with “checked out,” and maybe even “jumped in” is a little label-y? And on impact I said “made things feel a bit off,” which sounds pretty soft and not very owned.

Am I aiming at the right “main” issue with the moment, or would you actually flag the behavior or impact first? Sorry—I’m second-guessing myself.

**MentorAI:**

You’re reading it right—the anchor is the main gap, and that’s a common early stumble. Let’s nail that first and then we’ll tighten the rest. Which exact moment will you anchor to—Tuesday’s sync during your dependency update, or Thursday’s sprint planning while you walked the timeline—pick the one you can picture clearly and then rewrite your SBI in one pass with that single anchor?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think Tuesday’s sync during my dependency update is clearer for me—unless Thursday’s sprint planning is better for this kind of feedback? Okay, I’ll go with Tuesday.

In Tuesday’s team sync during my dependency update, you had Slack open and were typing while I walked through the risks, and then you jumped in while I was mid-sentence to ask if we could table it. It kind of came across like you were a bit checked out, and it made things feel a little off for me—I think I got a bit nervous and started rushing, and I probably skipped some context I meant to include.

Is that closer? I’m not sure if “jumped in” or “checked out” is me sliding into judgment again. And is the anchor specific enough now? Happy to tweak—just let me know where I should tighten first.

**MentorAI:**

Run your quick self-check on this draft: does it anchor to a single recognizable moment, are the behaviors camera-testable (pay special attention to “jumped in” and “checked out”), and is the impact owned and specific—what passes and what would you tweak?

**bailey_SBI:**

Quick self-check:

- Anchor (single recognizable moment): Mostly passes. “In Tuesday’s team sync during my dependency update” feels like one clear moment. If there were multiple syncs that week, I might add a cue (e.g., “the one right after standup”), but I think it’s probably specific enough—does that sound right?

- Behavior (camera-testable):
  - “You had Slack open and were typing” — seems camera-testable (I could see the app and typing). I’m second-guessing if “typing” is okay or if that’s still fine as an observation?
  - “You jumped in while I was mid-sentence” — borderline. I’d tweak to something like: “you started talking while I was mid-sentence, and our voices overlapped.”
  - “It came across like you were checked out” — that’s a judgment. I’d remove it and let the observable pieces carry it (Slack open + overlap).

- Impact (owned and specific):
  - Current: “made things feel a little off… I think I got a bit nervous and started rushing… probably skipped some context.”
  - Tweak: Own it and be specific: “I got nervous and sped up; I skipped context I’d planned to cover.” Maybe even, “I felt flustered and rushed, and I skipped two points.” Is that too strong?

If that direction sounds right, I can try a cleaned-up one-pass version next. And could you sanity-check whether “typing” and “sped up” feel okay here, or am I overthinking those?

**MentorAI:**

You’re on target. “Typing” is observable; keep it. Swap “jumped in” for “you started talking while I was mid-sentence and our voices overlapped,” and drop “checked out” (that’s judgment). Your impact tweak—“I got nervous and sped up; I skipped two points I’d planned to cover”—lands; not too strong. Anchor is specific enough unless there were multiple Tuesday syncs—if so, add one cue.

Go ahead and draft your cleaned one-pass now.

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s my cleaned one-pass:

In Tuesday’s team sync right after standup, during my dependency update on the vendor API risks, you had Slack open on your laptop and were typing while I walked through the risks, and you started talking while I was mid-sentence—our voices overlapped. I got nervous and sped up; I skipped two points I’d planned to cover.

Does that hit the mark? Is “right after standup” helpful or just extra? And is the wording about overlapping okay, or does it read clunky? Happy to tighten it.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—nice work. “Right after standup” is useful only if there were multiple Tuesday syncs; otherwise optional. “Our voices overlapped” reads clean; if you want plainer, “we talked over each other” works.

Let’s raise the stakes. Variation: You’re giving upward feedback to your manager. In Monday’s 10am client kickoff with NorthStar on Zoom, during your dependency‑risk slide, they had their email window open on a second monitor and were typing, and about 30 seconds in they said “Let’s move on” while you were mid‑sentence and advanced the slide. Draft your SBI for that moment in one pass.

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay—here’s my one pass:

In Monday’s 10am client kickoff with NorthStar on Zoom—during my dependency-risk slide—I think it was around the first minute, unless I’m mixing it up with our internal dry run—you had your email window open on a second monitor and were typing, and about 30 seconds in you said, “Let’s move on” while I was mid-sentence and advanced the slide. It kind of came across like you were already disengaged and a bit dismissive of the risks. I guess it made things feel a little off for me—I got a bit flustered and maybe rushed, and I think I skipped a couple of points I’d planned to cover.

Does that mostly land? I’m worried “disengaged”/“dismissive” is me slipping into judgment again. And do I need to be more exact on the timing, or is that level of specificity okay? Sorry if I muddied it.

**MentorAI:**

You’re right to flag “disengaged/dismissive”—that’s the one miss here. What works: your anchor is specific enough (no need for minute‑level timing), and your behaviors are camera‑testable. Cut the judgment sentence (“It kind of came across…”) and keep the rest.

Give me your revised one‑pass with that sentence removed.

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the revised one‑pass with that sentence removed:

In Monday’s 10am client kickoff with NorthStar on Zoom, during my dependency‑risk slide, you had your email window open on a second monitor and were typing, and about 30 seconds in you said “Let’s move on” while I was mid‑sentence and advanced the slide. I got a bit flustered and maybe rushed, and I think I skipped a couple of points I’d planned to cover.

Is that what you had in mind? Do you want me to keep the “about 30 seconds in” detail, or drop it since it’s not strictly necessary?

**MentorAI:**

This hits the mark—clear anchor, camera‑testable behavior, and owned impact. The “about 30 seconds in” detail isn’t needed unless it genuinely helps them locate the moment; I’d drop it for brevity. 

Quick reflection: what was the hardest part to get right in this round?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think the hardest part was cutting the judgments and trusting the plain, observable description—especially giving feedback upward to my manager. I kept wanting to add labels like “dismissive” so they’d understand how it felt, and then I’d overcorrect and soften my impact with “a bit/maybe.” I also felt the pull to over‑specify the moment (like the “30 seconds in”) to make it feel safer.

Does that sound like the right muscle to keep working—trusting camera‑testable behavior and stating the impact without the hedge words? If you have a quick micro‑check for catching judgment in the moment, I’d love it.

**MentorAI:**

That’s exactly the muscle. Takeaway: trust the tape and own your experience. Quick micro-check you can run in the moment: ask “Would a camera catch this word?”—if not, swap it for what you saw/heard; then state your impact once without hedges (“I got tense and rushed”).

**bailey_SBI:**

Got it—“trust the tape and own my experience,” plus the quick question: “Would a camera catch this word?” If no, swap to what I saw/heard, then state one clean impact without hedges.

Would you be up for a super quick micro-practice? Maybe you toss me a couple of judgment-y words (like “dismissive” or “unprepared”), and I’ll try converting them to camera-catchable behavior and add one owned impact. I’m a little nervous I’ll overthink it, but I think a 60-second rep would help lock it in. Does that sound okay?

**MentorAI:**

Good instinct—quick reps help lock it in ✅

Convert these two judgment words into SBI-ready lines: “dismissive” and “unprepared.” For each, give me one sentence with a camera-catchable behavior, and one sentence with your owned impact (emotion or consequence)—no hedges. Your turn.

**bailey_SBI:**

Dismissive
- Behavior: While I presented the update, you kept your email window open and were typing, and you didn’t make eye contact, like you weren’t interested.
- Impact: I felt a bit deflated and kind of rushed.

Unprepared
- Behavior: At the start of the meeting, you asked what the agenda was and where the deck we sent yesterday was, which made it seem like you hadn’t reviewed it.
- Impact: I got a little anxious and maybe second‑guessed what to cover.

Is this close, or did I slide back into judgment with those “like/made it seem” parts? And my impact lines probably still have hedges—should I strip those out more? Sorry if I missed the mark.

**MentorAI:**

You’re right—those “like…” and “made it seem…” tails are judgment leaks, and the hedge-y impacts can wait; this is a super common wobble early on. Let’s tighten one thing at a time: rewrite just the two behavior lines as single sentences that a camera could capture—keep the observable parts (e.g., email window open, typing; asked what the agenda was/where the deck was) and cut the inference tails—give me those two revised behavior sentences now.

**bailey_SBI:**

- Dismissive: While I presented the update, your email window was open on your second monitor and you were typing throughout the slide instead of paying attention.
- Unprepared: At the start of the meeting, you asked what the agenda was and where the deck we sent yesterday was, which suggested you hadn’t reviewed it.

Are these trimmed enough, or did I still leave judgment leaking in there? Sorry if I missed the mark.

**MentorAI:**

You’re close—the cores are solid. The only wobble is those tail phrases that sneak in interpretation. Which exact words in each sentence would a camera miss? Mark them mentally and cut them, then send me the two behavior sentences again with just the observables.

**bailey_SBI:**

- Dismissive: While I presented the update, your email window was open on your second monitor and you were typing.
- Unprepared: At the start of the meeting, you asked what the agenda was and where the deck we sent yesterday was.

Does that hit “camera-catchable” cleanly, or did I miss anything subtle?

**MentorAI:**

These are camera-catchable—nice cut 👍 Now add one owned impact sentence for each (emotion or consequence, no hedges). What’s your impact line for “dismissive,” and what’s your impact line for “unprepared”?

**bailey_SBI:**

- Dismissive — Impact: I think it made things feel a little off for me; I felt kind of deflated and started to rush a bit.
- Unprepared — Impact: I got a little anxious and maybe second‑guessed what to cover, so I might have glossed over some details.

Are these in the right neighborhood, or do I need to strip out the “a little/kind of/maybe” and make them cleaner? Sorry—I keep worrying I’m being too blunt if I say it straight.

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to want to soften—especially upward—and you’re not being “too blunt” when you own your experience. Strip the hedges and use a clean form: “I felt [emotion] and [past‑tense consequence].” One emotion, one consequence, no qualifiers.

Rewrite both impact lines with that form.

**bailey_SBI:**

- Dismissive — Impact: I felt deflated and rushed my delivery.
- Unprepared — Impact: I felt anxious and second‑guessed what to cover.

Does this match the “one emotion + one past‑tense consequence” form cleanly?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—both match the form cleanly and land; this isn’t “too blunt,” it’s appropriately owned. What single wording tweak from today will you carry into your next feedback conversation?

**bailey_SBI:**

The single tweak I’m going to carry forward is using the impact template: “I felt [emotion] and [past‑tense consequence].” For example, “I felt tense and rushed my delivery.” It helps me own it and cuts my “a little/maybe” hedges.

Does that seem like the highest‑leverage tweak for me right now, or would you rather I commit to one phrasing swap on behavior (like “you started talking while I was mid‑sentence” instead of “you interrupted me”)?

**MentorAI:**

Stick with the impact template as your single commitment—it’s the highest‑leverage tweak for you right now because it removes hedges and clearly signals ownership; the behavior phrasing swap is useful, but don’t split your focus yet. Will you lock that line in for your next feedback?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—I’ll lock it in: “I felt [emotion] and [past‑tense consequence].” My default will be, “I felt tense and rushed my delivery.” I’m going to stick that on a sticky note so I don’t hedge.

If I blank in the moment, is it okay to start with just “I felt tense” and then add the consequence a beat later? And could we do one 10‑second out‑loud rep now so it really sticks?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—starting with the emotion and adding the consequence a beat later is totally fine; you’re still owning it.

Quick 4-step micro-protocol when you blank:
1) Say the emotion: “I felt tense.” 
2) One breath. 
3) Add the past‑tense consequence: “and I rushed my delivery.” 
4) Stop—don’t add qualifiers.

Do one 10‑second out‑loud rep now and then type the exact sentence you said.

**bailey_SBI:**

I felt a bit tense and I rushed my delivery a little.

That’s exactly what I said out loud. I realize I added “a bit”/“a little”—sorry, I think I blanked. Do you want me to run it again without those?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal—under pressure those hedges sneak back in; no big deal. Let’s reset. Do one clean rep now—no “a bit” or “a little”: “I felt tense and I rushed my delivery.” Say it out loud, then type exactly what you said.
