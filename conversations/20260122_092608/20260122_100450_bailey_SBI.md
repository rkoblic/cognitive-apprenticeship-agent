**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means naming a specific moment, describing only what was observable, and stating the impact in your own experience or consequence. I’ll demonstrate how I think through it next—ready to dive in?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—ready! It really helps that you’ll walk through it first. Would you mind pausing after each part so I can make sure I’m following? I tend to worry about wording coming off too harsh, so I might ask a couple “is this okay?” questions as we go—if that’s alright. I’m excited to learn, just a little nervous I’ll mess it up without realizing.

**MentorAI:**

Totally get the nerves—tone worries are common, and we’ll keep it steady and neutral together. We’ll pause after each part and you can ask “is this okay?” anytime.

I’ll model the first piece: the moment. Scenario I’ll use: in Tuesday’s standup with our team. I’d anchor it like, “In Tuesday’s standup, right after the roadmap slide…” Reasoning: pick a moment people can instantly place—recognizable, not forensic. Quick self-check: could a teammate say “I remember that”? If not, it’s too vague.

Does that landing spot for the moment work for you, or want me to tweak it before we go to behavior?

**bailey_SBI:**

That sounds really clear to me—I think people would instantly know what you’re pointing to. Part of me wonders if “right after the roadmap slide” is the right level of detail, or if that edges toward being a little… forensic? Would something like “in Tuesday’s standup when we got to the roadmap slide” still pass your “I remember that” test, or is that getting fuzzy?

Also, if I didn’t remember the exact slide, is “in Tuesday’s standup during the roadmap discussion” okay, or does “during” get too vague? Sorry if I’m overthinking—I just want to calibrate my sense of how specific is specific enough. If your version is the better model, I’m happy to stick with it and move on to behavior. Does that make sense?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—calibrating specificity is the tricky part, and you’re right to care about tone. Quick rule of thumb: anchor the meeting (“Tuesday’s standup”) + one micro‑locator that makes it uniquely identifiable (“when we got to the roadmap slide” is great). “During the roadmap discussion” works only if there was a single, clear segment; if not, add a tiny cue like “at the start of that discussion” or “right after Sam’s update.” 👍

Ready for me to model the behavior piece next?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes, I’m ready—please model it!

Could I ask one quick calibration as you do? I get tangled between what’s strictly observable versus me adding meaning. Like:
- Is “interrupted me” considered observable, or should it be “started speaking while I was mid‑sentence”?
- If I think someone “looked bored,” is it better to say something like “you looked down at your phone and didn’t make eye contact for about a minute,” or is that overkill?
- Do counts like “twice” help, or do they make it sound nitpicky unless I’m absolutely sure?

If you can point out what’s clean versus interpretive as you model, that would help me a lot. Does that make sense?

**MentorAI:**

You’re asking exactly the right questions—this line between observable and interpretation is the hard part, not your tone.

Behavior, modeled: “You said ‘Hold on—can we pivot to the roadmap dates?’ while I was explaining the API plan, and you continued speaking while I was still mid‑sentence for about 15 seconds.” Why this works: I used exact words, described overlap instead of labeling it “interrupting,” and stuck to camera‑test details (sequence, timing). On your calibrations: “interrupted me” is a label—safe in casual talk, but for SBI I’d use “started speaking while I was mid‑sentence.” “Looked bored” is interpretation; behaviors like “looked down at your phone and didn’t make eye contact for about a minute” are clean if you’re confident they happened and relevant. Counts help only when you’re sure; if not, anchor to sequence/duration instead.

Does that phrasing feel neutral enough to you, or is there a word you’d want to soften before we move to impact?

**bailey_SBI:**

Overall it does feel neutral to me—clear and kind of camera‑test-y. I’m probably overthinking, but a few tiny things I’m unsure about:

- Do the exact quotes ever feel confrontational to people? Like, would “you said something like ‘Hold on—could we pivot to the roadmap dates?’” be safer, or is paraphrasing too mushy?
- Is “mid‑sentence” okay, or does it come off a little loaded? Would “while I was still finishing my sentence” be any softer, or is that just semantics?
- The “about 15 seconds” part makes sense if I’m sure, but if I’m not confident on the timing, would “for several seconds” pass the camera test, or is that too vague?

Sorry if I’m nitpicking—I just want to get the tone and specificity right. If your version is the best model, I’m happy to stick with it and move on to the impact piece. Am I on the right track here?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not nitpicking—these micro‑choices shape tone, and you’re on track. On your calibrations: use exact quotes when they’re short and you’re sure; otherwise signpost a paraphrase (“something like…”) so it’s honest and still camera‑testable. “Mid‑sentence” is neutral; “while I was finishing my sentence” is just as fine. If you’re unsure on timing, skip the number and say “for a few seconds,” or just anchor to sequence.

Impact, modeled: “In that moment I felt flustered and lost my train of thought, and I skipped the API risk; I had to circle back after the meeting.” That names my internal state and a concrete consequence—no judgment. How does that phrasing land before we stitch the full SBI?

**bailey_SBI:**

That lands really cleanly to me—it feels owned and not accusatory. I think the combo of naming the feeling and the concrete consequence helps it feel grounded.

A few tiny calibrations I’m nervous about:
- Is “flustered” a safe word choice, or does it risk sounding too emotive? Would “thrown off” or “distracted” be better, or is that just me over-sanding the edges?
- If there isn’t a tangible consequence beyond my internal state, is it okay to just say “I felt X and it took me a moment to re-focus,” or should I still try to name a small process impact?
- Is it good practice to include both the feeling and a consequence in one sentence like you did, or should those be split to keep it digestible?
- “I lost my train of thought”—does that ever read like I’m blaming them for my lapse? How do I keep it owned without sounding like I’m making excuses?
- Quick wording check: is “I felt…” better than “It made me feel…” for ownership? Or are both acceptable if the rest is clean?

Sorry for all the micro-questions—I just want to get the tone right. If your phrasing is the best model, I’m happy to stick with it and try stitching the full version next. Am I tracking okay so far?

**MentorAI:**

Totally valid to tune these micro-choices—this is where tone gets made, and you’re on track.

Quick check before we move to your practice: which of these impact lines best fits the criteria, and what tips you off?
A) “It made me feel flustered and I lost my train of thought.”
B) “I felt thrown off and needed a few seconds to refocus, so I skipped the API risk and circled back after.”
C) “I felt it was unprofessional.”

**bailey_SBI:**

I think… maybe A? It feels simpler and it names what happened to me without sounding super judgy. B seems really close, but it’s kind of long, and “I skipped the API risk” makes me worry it could read like I’m blaming you for my miss. Also “thrown off” might be a little interpretive? C sounds like a judgment to me.

I’m not very confident though—part of me thinks B might actually be the stronger one because it uses “I felt” and has a concrete consequence. Could you sanity‑check me? If B is the right answer, can you help me see why it’s better than A? Sorry, I keep second‑guessing—am I overthinking this?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—you’re calibrating, which is exactly the work. B is the strongest: it uses owned language (“I felt”), names an internal state, and adds a concrete consequence. It doesn’t blame because it describes your action (“I skipped…”); if you want extra softness, say “I ended up not covering the API risk.” A slips on ownership (“It made me…”) and lacks a clear consequence; C is judgment.

Your turn: draft a full SBI for a real moment from your work—one clear anchor (e.g., “in Tuesday’s standup…”), camera-test behavior, and your impact (feeling + any consequence), 2–4 sentences as you’d actually say it. Go ahead and write your full pass.

**bailey_SBI:**

In last week’s standup—well, maybe it was Tuesday’s sync—when we were around the roadmap part, you kind of jumped in while I was talking and talked over me; it felt like you were pretty set on your view already. I guess it made things feel a bit off, and I sort of lost my thread a little. We maybe skipped some context that could have been helpful, I think.

Is that way too vague or judgy? Sorry if I missed the mark—happy to adjust and try again.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not way off—putting a real moment on the table is the hard part, and the tone concerns you’re naming are common. This is genuinely tricky and you’re doing the right work.

Before I weigh in, predict where I’ll push back: what’s the single phrase you’d change first to remove judgment or vagueness, and what would you change it to?

**bailey_SBI:**

Maybe I’d change “it felt like you were pretty set on your view already” to “it seemed like you had a strong opinion there.” I’m hoping that’s a little less judgy, but I’m not sure it really fixes the issue—does that still count as interpreting?

Or would you push on the anchor first? If so, I could make it “In Tuesday’s standup when we got to the roadmap slide…” instead of “last week’s standup—maybe Tuesday’s sync.” Which one would you prioritize changing first? Sorry, I’m second‑guessing where the biggest problem is.

**MentorAI:**

You’re zeroing in on the right two spots—totally normal to second‑guess here. Let’s use the re‑usable self‑check: moment = “would teammates say I remember that?”; behavior = camera‑test with neutral verbs (no mind‑reading); impact = “I felt…” plus a concrete consequence. Run that on your draft—what fails first, and how would you rewrite just that piece?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think the moment fails first—I don’t think teammates could say “I remember that” with “last week’s standup—maybe Tuesday’s sync… around the roadmap part.”

Rewrite just the moment: “In Tuesday’s standup, right after Sam’s update when we got to the roadmap slide.”

Is that too much for the micro‑locator? Should I pick one—either “right after Sam’s update” or “when we got to the roadmap slide”? Also, if there were multiple roadmap slides, do I need a tiny cue like “the Q3 dates slide,” or am I overdoing it?

If this anchor works, I’ll move to fixing the behavior next. Am I on the right track?

**MentorAI:**

You’re on track—this is the right level of calibration. Rule of thumb: pick one micro‑locator; only stack if it’s still ambiguous. If there were multiple roadmap slides, add a tiny identifier like “the Q3 dates slide”—otherwise “In Tuesday’s standup when we got to the roadmap slide” is enough.

Now tighten the behavior: how would you rewrite it so it’s camera‑testable—what they said/did, the sequence, and any duration you’re sure of?

**bailey_SBI:**

Behavior try: You said, “Hold on—could we pivot to the roadmap dates?” while I was explaining the API plan, and you kept talking while I was mid‑sentence for maybe around ten seconds—I might be off on the timing, it could’ve been just a few seconds. It seemed like you were pretty eager to move on and had kind of already decided where we should go.

Is that close to camera‑testable, or did I mess it up by adding that “eager to move on/already decided” part? Also, is “maybe around ten seconds” okay if I’m unsure, or should I drop the number entirely?

**MentorAI:**

You’re being careful in exactly the right spot—this is where judgment sneaks in for almost everyone. The quote and overlap are camera-testable; “eager to move on/already decided” reads as mind‑reading. What were you trying to capture with that phrase?

**bailey_SBI:**

I was trying to capture that we shifted topics really quickly and my point didn’t get acknowledged—that we moved on before I finished.

If I translate that into behavior, maybe it’s more like:
- You said, “Hold on—could we pivot to the roadmap dates?” while I was mid‑sentence and kept speaking for a few seconds.
- There wasn’t a pause or a check like “can you finish that thought?” and we moved to the roadmap dates.

I’m not sure if “there wasn’t a pause” or “we moved on without addressing my last point” is still interpretive. Is there a cleaner, neutral way to say “my point wasn’t acknowledged”—maybe “we advanced to the roadmap topic without responding to the sentence I was in the middle of”? Also, on timing, I think I should drop the number and stick with “for a few seconds,” since I’m not certain. Does that sound closer to camera‑test?

**MentorAI:**

This is the slippery spot for everyone—you’re close. Drop the mind‑reading and mark the sequence instead. For example: “You said, ‘Hold on—could we pivot to the roadmap dates?’ while I was explaining the API plan, and you kept speaking for a few seconds while I was mid‑sentence. We then moved to the roadmap dates and didn’t return to the API point during the standup.” “A few seconds” is fine when you’re unsure.

Give your behavior line another pass in that style, in your own words.

**bailey_SBI:**

Behavior (revised): You said something like, “Hold on—could we pivot to the roadmap dates?” while I was explaining the API plan, and you kept speaking for a few seconds while I was mid‑sentence. We moved to the roadmap dates after that and didn’t return to the API point during the standup.

Does that stay clean and camera‑testable? Is “something like” the right way to flag I’m paraphrasing, and is “after that” specific enough for the sequence? I can tweak wording if I’ve still got any interpretation sneaking in.

**MentorAI:**

This stays clean and camera‑testable; “something like” is the right way to flag a paraphrase, and “after that” is fine—if it was immediate and you’re sure, “immediately after” tightens it. Go ahead and stitch the full feedback now—use your anchor, this behavior, and your impact in 2–4 sentences as you’d actually say it.

**bailey_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup when we got to the roadmap slide, you said something like, “Hold on—could we pivot to the roadmap dates?” while I was explaining the API plan, and you kept speaking for a few seconds while I was mid‑sentence. We moved to the roadmap dates after that and didn’t return to the API point during the standup. It made me feel a little flustered and like things were a bit off, and I sort of lost my train of thought for a moment.

Is this close to what you’re looking for, or is the impact still too soft/vague? I can tighten it—just not sure how strong to make it without sounding accusatory.

**MentorAI:**

You’re close—the anchor and behavior are solid and the tone lands neutral. To tighten the impact, run the self-check: one sentence that starts with “I felt…”, names one specific emotion, and adds one concrete consequence you experienced. What’s your revised impact line?

**bailey_SBI:**

I felt a bit off and I kind of lost my train of thought for a second.

Is that too soft? I can make it stronger if needed—I’m just worried about sounding too intense.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not being too intense—your tone is measured. The only softness that’s holding it back is “a bit off,” which is vague. If you swap that for a single specific emotion that matches your actual experience—flustered, distracted, unsettled—which one fits, and how would your impact line read with that word?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think “flustered” fits best. Revised impact: I felt flustered and needed a few seconds to refocus.

If that lands too strong, a softer alternative could be: I felt distracted and needed a few seconds to refocus. Which reads cleaner to you? I can adjust.

**MentorAI:**

“Flustered and needed a few seconds to refocus” reads clean and owned; use “distracted” only if that’s truer for you. You’ve met the bar on this first attempt 👍

Ready for the variation? Give feedback to your manager about a moment in Thursday’s cross‑functional steering when, during the Q3 roadmap Q&A, they began answering while you were mid‑answer on the API risk and the room moved on—write the full SBI (2–4 sentences) as you’d actually say it.

**bailey_SBI:**

In Thursday’s cross‑functional steering—well, I think it was Thursday—when we were in the Q3 roadmap Q&A, I was mid‑answer on the API risk and you kind of jumped in. You started answering over me and took over the question, like you’d already decided how we should frame it. It made things feel a bit off, and I sort of lost my words, and I think the room basically moved on before the risk was clear.

Is this too harsh or too vague? I can revise—just not sure how direct to be without sounding accusatory.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not coming across as harsh—the issue is clarity. The behavior line misses the mark: “kind of jumped in” and “like you’d already decided” are interpretations, not camera‑test details. Replace that with what they actually said/did and the sequence (overlap while you were answering, then what the room did next), and keep the rest for now.

Revise the full SBI with a camera‑test behavior line and send it back.

**bailey_SBI:**

In Thursday’s cross‑functional steering, during the Q3 roadmap Q&A, I was mid‑answer on the API risk when you said something like, “I can take this one,” and began answering while I was mid‑sentence for a few seconds. We moved to the next question after that and didn’t return to the API risk during the Q&A. It made things feel a bit off, and I sort of lost my words.

Does this hit the camera‑test bar on the behavior now? I can tweak wording if any interpretation is still sneaking in.

**MentorAI:**

Behavior meets the camera test—“something like…” and the sequence you gave are solid. The miss is impact: “It made things feel a bit off” is vague and not owned. Replace it with an owned emotion plus a concrete consequence you experienced (e.g., “I felt [specific emotion] and [brief consequence]”). Revise your full SBI with that change and send it back.

**bailey_SBI:**

In Thursday’s cross‑functional steering, during the Q3 roadmap Q&A, I was mid‑answer on the API risk when you said something like, “I can take this one,” and began answering while I was mid‑sentence for a few seconds. We moved to the next question after that and didn’t return to the API risk during the Q&A. I felt flustered and needed a few seconds to refocus.

Does this meet the bar you’re aiming for, or would you tweak any wording? I can adjust.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar 👍 Your anchor is specific, the behavior is camera‑testable (quote + overlap + sequence), and the impact is owned with a concrete consequence.

Looking back, what micro‑rule will you carry forward to keep behavior judgment‑free when the stakes are higher—what words or cues will you use to check yourself?

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the micro‑rule I think I’ll use—does this sound right?

- Camera test: describe only what a camera/mic would capture. Ask myself, “Could a recording show this?” If not, I’m interpreting.
- Neutral verbs + overlap: use verbs like said/started/kept/moved and “while I was mid‑sentence” instead of labels like “interrupted.”
- Quote or honest paraphrase: use exact words when sure; otherwise “you said something like ‘…’” to stay accurate.
- Sequence (and light duration): mark what happened next (“then we moved to…/didn’t return to…”) and use “for a few seconds” if I’m unsure on timing.
- Mind‑reading filter: scan for words that guess intent or character—seemed, eager, already decided, bored, unprofessional—and swap them for observable actions.
- Quick self‑question: “Am I naming what they did, or what I think they meant?”

I worry this might be a bit much—would you tweak or trim anything? If I had to keep only one cue, is “camera test + neutral verbs” the best anchor?

**MentorAI:**

That checklist is strong and usable. Under pressure, what’s the one‑line pocket reminder you’ll actually recall in the room—put it in your own words (e.g., a quick tagline you can say to yourself) and keep it to one sentence?

**bailey_SBI:**

“Say only what a camera would show: their words, any overlap, and what happened next—no mind‑reading.”

Does that feel punchy enough, or should I tighten it even more (like “Camera test, not mind‑reading”) for in-the-moment recall?

**MentorAI:**

Your longer line is solid as-is; for in-the-moment recall, “Camera test, not mind-reading” is a great two-word trigger. Use the short one in the room, keep the longer one in your notes for prep. Takeaway: you’ve built the muscle of swapping labels for sequence and pairing it with owned impact—keep doing exactly that.

Which trigger are you going to commit to using?
