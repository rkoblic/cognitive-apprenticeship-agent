**MentorAI:**

We’re going to practice delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a real moment, describe only observable behavior, and name your own impact in owned language—then you’ll do two full attempts. I’ll demonstrate first so you can see how I think it through—ready to start?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—ready. Seeing how you think it through will be really helpful. Do you want me to be thinking of a situation while you demo, or wait until after? I have a couple in mind, but I’m not sure which one’s better, so I don’t want to get ahead of myself.

Also, quick check: when you say “owned language,” do you mean literally starting with “I felt,” or just generally not blaming the other person? I just want to make sure I’m tracking before we dive in.

**MentorAI:**

Hold your situation until after the demo—you’ll pick more confidently once you’ve seen how I choose moments. And “owned language” means naming your internal state or a direct consequence in I-language (e.g., “I felt frustrated/I had to rework it”), not a judgment like “I felt it was unprofessional.”

Here’s my quick demo, thinking out loud in five steps:
1) Pick a real moment: “In Tuesday’s standup, when it was my turn to share updates…”
2) Describe only what a camera would catch: “you started talking while I was mid-sentence and finished the update for me.”
3) Name my impact in owned language: “I felt sidelined and lost my train of thought; I left out a dependency and had to follow up after the meeting.”
4) Say it cleanly: “In Tuesday’s standup, when it was my turn, you began talking while I was mid-sentence and finished the update. I felt sidelined and lost my thread, and I had to follow up later to cover what I missed.”
5) Self-check I use: time anchor specific enough to recognize, behavior passes the camera test (no labels like “steamrolled”), impact is my felt state or concrete consequence I experienced.

Pause there. Ready to pick one of your situations and draft your full SBI? 👍

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, I’ll try. For the situation, I was thinking maybe the project sync last week—um, the Thursday afternoon one? Or it might have been Monday at 2pm. There have been a couple like this, so I’m not totally sure which is better to pick.

Drafting it out:
- Situation: “In our project sync the other day, when we were talking through Q1 priorities…”
- Behavior: “you kept looking at your phone and kind of sighing, and you seemed pretty checked out, like not that interested.”
- Impact: “It sort of made the conversation feel a bit off and a little rushed, and I guess I maybe lost my train of thought a little.”

Is that anywhere close? I’m worried “seemed checked out” probably isn’t camera-test-y, but “kept looking at your phone” feels kind of harsh too. Sorry if that’s not the right balance—can you tell me what I should fix first?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not off—this part trips a lot of people up, and naming observable things isn’t harsh; it’s actually kinder than labels. You already spotted where judgment crept in, which is good.

Let’s lock the anchor first: which single meeting will you choose—Thursday afternoon or Monday at 2pm—and can you restate your first line with that specific moment?

**bailey_SBI:**

Hmm, I’m torn. My gut says Thursday afternoon because it’s fresher, but Monday at 2pm might be clearer since the time is exact. Which would be better for this?

If I go with Thursday, maybe: “In our Thursday afternoon project sync, when we were talking through Q1 priorities…” Is that specific enough to count as a solid anchor, or do I need the exact time or room to make it recognizable? I can switch to Monday if that’s cleaner.

**MentorAI:**

You don’t need forensic precision here—just a recognizable moment. If there was only one project sync last Thursday afternoon, that’s specific enough; pairing it with “when we were reviewing Q1 priorities” locks it in. Want to go with Thursday and restate your first line using that anchor?

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, I’ll go with Thursday. Maybe: “In last Thursday’s project sync, when we were reviewing Q1 priorities…”

Or should it be: “In our Thursday afternoon project sync, when we were reviewing Q1 priorities…”?

Does that pass your “recognizable moment” check, or do I need to add the time (I think it was around 3pm) or the Zoom title to make sure it’s specific enough? I can adjust.

**MentorAI:**

You’re in the right zone—no need for exact times or Zoom titles. “In last Thursday’s project sync, when we were reviewing Q1 priorities…” is specific enough to anchor the moment. Use that and draft your full SBI in one go—include what a camera would’ve seen and your own impact—ready to take a pass? 👍

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, here’s a full pass:

“In last Thursday’s project sync, when we were reviewing Q1 priorities, you looked down at your phone a few times and sighed, and you seemed kind of checked out or maybe a bit impatient. It made the conversation feel a little off and a bit rushed, and I kind of lost my train of thought and maybe skipped a point.”

Is that anywhere close to what you’re looking for? I’m pretty sure “seemed checked out/impatient” drifts into judgment, but just saying the phone/sighing felt weirdly harsh. And for the impact, I don’t know if “made it feel off” is too vague—should I say “I felt…” there, or is “it made the convo feel…” okay? Happy to tweak—what should I fix first?

**MentorAI:**

You’re reading it right—this balance is tricky, and noticing where judgment creeps in is a good sign you’re on track. Before I weigh in, name the exact words you think I’ll ask you to change first—and why.

**bailey_SBI:**

I think the first thing you’d ask me to change is the “seemed kind of checked out” and “maybe a bit impatient” part—those feel like labels/interpretations, not what a camera would catch.

Second would probably be “It made the conversation feel a little off,” because that isn’t really owned—it’s vague and not about my state.

I’m also wondering (maybe overthinking?) if “a few times” in “looked down at your phone a few times” is too fuzzy, and whether “sighed” sounds judge-y even though it’s observable. Are those actually problems, or am I inventing them? Can you sanity-check which one you’d have me fix first?

**MentorAI:**

You’re reading it well—your instincts about the labels are right. Let’s fix one thing first: drop the interpretive bits (“seemed checked out/impatient”) and keep only what a camera would catch; “a few times” and “sighed” are fine. What does your behavior line become when you rewrite it that way?

**bailey_SBI:**

How about: “You looked down at your phone a few times and sighed while I was talking, which made it seem like you weren’t really engaged.”

I’m guessing that last clause is still interpretive and should be cut—should I stop at the phone/sighing part? Sorry if I’m overthinking it.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—this is exactly the muscle we’re building, and “sighed”/“a few times” are fine because a camera would catch them. That last clause is interpretive, so cut it and stop at the observable actions. Can you write the behavior as one clean sentence that ends after what the phone and sighing looked like while you were talking?

**bailey_SBI:**

How about: “While I was talking, you looked down at your phone three times, unlocked it and scrolled each time, and you sighed twice.”

Is that clean enough, or is the “unlocked it and scrolled” detail too much and I should just say “looked at your phone a few times and sighed”? Happy to simplify—just want to make sure it still passes your camera test.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—both versions pass the camera test. What made you choose the precise counts (“three times… twice”) over something like “a few times,” and what effect are you aiming for with that choice?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think I went with the precise counts to sound more factual—like, “I noticed this specifically,” so it doesn’t come across as me exaggerating. I was aiming for clarity and credibility.

But I’m worried it might feel a bit… tally-keeping? Like I was counting infractions, which could make someone defensive. “A few times” feels gentler and maybe less accusatory, but then I’m afraid it’s too fuzzy and loses weight.

Is there a rule of thumb here—use exact counts only when they help the listener picture it, and otherwise stick with “a few times”? Or even “about three times” as a middle ground? I can’t tell which strikes the better balance—what would you steer me toward?

**MentorAI:**

Rule of thumb: use exact counts only if you naturally noticed them and they help the other person picture the moment; otherwise use a simple quantifier like “a few times”—it’s concrete enough without the tally-keeping vibe. Skip hedged numbers like “about three,” which read as approximate but still nitpicky. For this one, I’d steer you to “a few times” so you can keep it neutral—plug that into your line and share your full SBI again.

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay—here’s the full pass with “a few times”:

“In last Thursday’s project sync, when we were reviewing Q1 priorities, while I was talking you looked at your phone a few times and sighed. I felt a bit thrown off and like you weren’t that interested, and I lost my train of thought and skipped mentioning a dependency, so I followed up after the meeting.”

Is that closer? I’m guessing the “I felt like you weren’t that interested” part might still be interpretive. If so, should I swap that for something like “I felt distracted/concerned,” or is there a better way to keep it about my state? Sorry—just want to make sure I’m landing it right.

**MentorAI:**

You’re very close—your anchor and behavior pass the test. One thing to tighten: “I felt like you weren’t that interested” reads as interpreting their intent; keep it to your internal state plus the concrete consequence (you already have the train-of-thought and follow-up). What would your impact line be if you cut that interpretation and named your feeling in your own words, then the consequence you experienced?

**bailey_SBI:**

Maybe something like: “It made the conversation feel a bit off and kind of rushed, and I sort of lost my thread and had to follow up afterward.”

Does that count as naming my feeling, or is that still not owned enough? I’m not sure if “off” even qualifies as a feeling—do I need to use “I felt …” there? Sorry if I’m missing the mark.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not missing the mark—“off” isn’t a feeling, so your instinct is right. Try this: drop “it made…,” start with “I felt [your word],” then keep the concrete consequence you experienced. Give me your impact sentence using one feeling word that actually fits you (e.g., distracted/rushed/flustered—your choice) and the follow-up you had to do. What’s it sound like now?

**bailey_SBI:**

I felt flustered, and I lost my train of thought and had to follow up after the meeting to cover the dependency I skipped.

Does that fit what you meant by owning the impact, or is “flustered” too strong and I should use something like “distracted”?

**MentorAI:**

That fits the owned-impact bar—naming “I felt flustered” plus the concrete consequence is exactly it, and the word choice should match your actual experience, not politeness. “Flustered” isn’t too strong if that’s true for you; “distracted” works if that’s what you actually felt.

Which word is truer to what you felt in that moment—flustered or distracted?

**bailey_SBI:**

If I’m being honest, “flustered” feels truer—I remember my heart kind of jumping and my thoughts scrambling, which is more than just distracted. I’m a little worried it sounds dramatic, but that’s what it felt like.

Does sticking with “flustered” make sense here, or would you steer me toward “distracted” to keep it from sounding too intense?

**MentorAI:**

Naming “flustered” isn’t dramatic—it’s honest, and it helps the other person understand the impact. If that’s what you felt, stick with it. Want to put the whole thing together now as one clean draft and share it?

**bailey_SBI:**

Here’s the full draft:

“In last Thursday’s project sync, when we were reviewing Q1 priorities, while I was talking you looked at your phone a few times and sighed. I felt flustered and lost my train of thought, and I had to follow up after the meeting to cover the dependency I skipped.”

Does that meet the bar, or is there anything you’d tighten? I’m a little nervous “looked at your phone” will land harshly, even though I know it’s observable.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you’re worried it’ll land harshly—naming what a camera would see is actually steadier and kinder than implying motive, and you’ve kept it clean. Run your self-check on this: does your draft hit all three—recognizable moment, behavior that passes the camera test, and impact in owned language—and what’s your verdict?

**bailey_SBI:**

- Recognizable moment: I think “In last Thursday’s project sync, when we were reviewing Q1 priorities” is specific enough, but part of me worries if there were multiple Thursday syncs it could be confusing. It feels passable, though.

- Behavior/camera test: “While I was talking you looked at your phone a few times and sighed” seems camera-clean to me, but I’m a little nervous that “looked at your phone” could read like I’m implying disengagement even if I’m not saying that. “Sighed” also makes me worry I’m shading it negative, even though a camera would catch it.

- Owned impact: “I felt flustered… and I had to follow up” seems to check the box—feeling plus concrete consequence. I’m not sure if having both the feeling and the follow-up in one sentence is too much, or if that’s actually ideal.

Verdict: I think it mostly hits all three, but I don’t totally trust my read—maybe like a 90% yes? Can you sanity-check whether the anchor and the behavior phrasing are solid, and confirm if combining the feeling and consequence in one sentence is what you’d want? Sorry if I’m over-nitpicking.

**MentorAI:**

You’re being careful in the right ways. This draft meets the bar—anchor is specific, behavior is camera-clean, and your owned impact lands; it’s fine to keep the feeling and consequence in one sentence.

Second rep, higher stakes: this Monday’s client steering committee on Zoom, while you were presenting Q1 priorities, your manager jumped in mid-sentence to answer the client and finished your explanation. Give me a full SBI for that scenario.

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, here’s a first pass:

“In this Monday’s client steering committee on Zoom, while I was presenting Q1 priorities, you jumped in while I was mid-sentence to answer the client and finished my explanation—basically took over my answer. It made the moment feel a bit awkward and kind of undercutting, and I guess I maybe lost my place a little and rushed the rest.”

Is that anywhere close to what you’re looking for? I’m guessing “took over”/“undercutting” might be drift into interpretation, and I’m not sure if I should have said “I felt…” instead of “it made the moment feel…”. What would you want me to fix first? Sorry if I’m off.

**MentorAI:**

You’re on the right track, and your instinct about “took over”/“undercutting” is spot on.

What lands: the anchor is clear; the behavior is camera-clean up to “finished my explanation.” What to fix: cut “took over” (interpretive) and rewrite the impact in owned language—name your feeling (“I felt…”) and the direct consequence you experienced; drop the hedging (“I guess I maybe”). Give me the revised full SBI.

**bailey_SBI:**

“In this Monday’s client steering committee on Zoom, while I was presenting Q1 priorities, you jumped in while I was mid-sentence to answer the client and finished my explanation. I felt sidelined and lost my train of thought, and I rushed the rest of my section and missed a point, so I had to follow up after the meeting.”

Does that hit what you were aiming for, or would you tighten any wording? I’m a little nervous “sidelined” might be too strong, even though it’s what I felt.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—your anchor is specific, the behavior is camera-clean, and the impact is owned. “Sidelined” is fine if that’s what you actually felt; naming it helps them understand the effect. 

Quick look back: what principle will you carry forward the next time you’re worried that saying what you saw or felt might sound harsh?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think the principle is: clarity is kinder. When I’m worried it’ll sound harsh, I should stick to what a camera would’ve seen and name my own impact with “I felt…” or “I had to…,” and drop motives or labels. If it feels harsh, that’s a cue to strip interpretation—not to blur the facts.

Does that capture what you want me to carry forward, or would you tweak it?

**MentorAI:**

That nails it. Takeaway to keep: when something feels harsh, don’t blur the facts—strip interpretation instead; keep behavior camera-visible and keep impact in I-language, and if a motive/label sneaks in, swap it for a sensory action you actually saw. That’s the muscle you built today—nicely done.

**bailey_SBI:**

Thank you—this really helped. I feel like I got it with your coaching, but I’m still a little worried about doing it solo in the moment.

Would a simple pocket cue like “Camera > I felt > I had to…” be the right self-check to keep on a sticky note? And is it okay to pause for a beat in real time—like, “Give me a second to say this clearly”—so I don’t slip into labels?

Also, for practice, would you suggest I try one low-stakes rep this week (written or quick 1:1) and then one live in a meeting? Does that sound like a good way to build the muscle without feeling robotic?

**MentorAI:**

Totally fair to feel wobbly going solo—pausing is a strength here, not a flaw. Here’s a simple four-step micro-routine you can use:
1) Pause: “Give me a second to say this clearly.”
2) Run your cue: Camera > I felt > I had to…
3) Say it in one breath: “In [moment], [camera-visible action]. I felt [your word], and I [consequence].”
4) Reps this week: do one low‑stakes written or 1:1, then one live in a meeting; debrief yourself for 30 seconds after each.

Which part of that routine will make the biggest difference for you right now?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think the Pause line will make the biggest difference for me—giving myself explicit permission to slow down is what keeps me from blurting the labels. Right behind that is running the “Camera > I felt > I had to…” cue so I don’t drift into motives.

Quick checks:
- Is it okay to use “Give me a second to say this clearly” even with senior folks/clients, or should I soften it?
- For the “one breath,” is it fine as two short sentences—camera sentence, then “I felt…, and I …”—so it doesn’t sound robotic?

I’ll put the cue on a sticky note and try one written/1:1 rep tomorrow and one live in Friday’s standup. Does that sound like the right level to start, or should I start even smaller?

**MentorAI:**

You’re thinking about this exactly right—pausing reads as thoughtful, not weak. With senior folks/clients, keep the pause line concise and neutral: “Give me a moment to say this clearly,” “Let me be precise for a second,” or “One moment—I’ll say this cleanly.” Two short sentences is ideal: “In [moment], [camera‑visible action]. I felt [your word], and I [consequence].” Your plan—one written/1:1 rep, then one live Friday—sounds like the right ramp 👍

Which pause line will you commit to verbatim this week?
