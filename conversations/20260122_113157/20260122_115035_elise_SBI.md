**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI in a professional context. Success means you anchor to a real moment, describe camera-testable behavior (no judgments), and name your own impact in owned language—plus you can spot when judgment sneaks into behavior. I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll practice—ready to dive in?

**elise_SBI:**

I’m ready to try—at least I think so. Could I just check I’ve got the targets straight? It’s: anchor to a real moment, describe behavior that a camera could verify, and then name my own impact in “I” language… and keep an eye out for any judgment sneaking into the behavior part. Did I capture that correctly?

On “camera-testable,” would something like “you checked your phone three times during the 10am meeting” pass that test, whereas “you seemed disengaged” would be more of a judgment? Or am I oversimplifying?

And do you want me to just listen to your demo first, or should I be jotting notes or a template as you go? Sorry if that’s overthinking—it helps me to know what you prefer.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fair to check—your read is right on, and that phone vs “seemed disengaged” example nails the camera test 👍. While I demo, jot light bullets only: the concrete moment, the observable verb phrase, and the “I” impact word/phrase—no template needed. Ready for the demo?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—ready. I’ll keep light bullets: the concrete moment, an observable verb phrase, and my “I” impact word.

Is it okay if I pause for a couple seconds to jot as you go, or would you prefer I wait until the end of the demo to write? Also, do you want me to hold questions until the end, or is a quick clarifying check-in okay?

And just to be sure I’m thinking at the right level for the verb phrase—something like “closed the document while I was speaking” vs. “ignored my input”? If that’s too much right now, I can just watch and take it in. Sorry—I just don’t want to overstep.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overstepping—those distinctions you’re making are exactly the right grain, and “closed the document…” is camera-testable while “ignored my input” is a judgment. Quick pauses to jot are fine, and a brief clarifying check-in during the demo is okay.

Here’s the demo. I’ll pick one concrete moment, name one observable behavior, then my owned impact, and do a quick self-check out loud. In Tuesday’s 10am standup, while I was walking through the backlog change, you spoke over me twice before I finished the sentence. I felt rushed and lost my train of thought, and I had to circle back later, which stretched the standup. Why this works: “Tuesday’s 10am standup” anchors; “spoke over me twice…” passes the camera test (I avoided words like “dismissive”); “I felt rushed…” is my internal state plus a direct consequence to me. Self-check I run: moment named? behavior filmable? impact in “I” language? no judgments snuck into the behavior?

What, if anything, do you want me to replay before we move to your first full attempt?

**elise_SBI:**

Could you replay your self-check questions one more time—maybe a touch slower? I think I caught “moment named, behavior filmable, impact in ‘I’ language, no judgments in behavior,” but I’m worried I’m glossing over something.

Also, on the impact piece: you said “I felt rushed and lost my train of thought, and I had to circle back later, which stretched the standup.” Is it okay that that mixes my internal state with a ripple effect on the meeting time? I think that works, but part of me wonders if adding the “stretched the standup” drifts from owned impact into broader consequence—does that still count as impact in this framework?

And tiny wording thing: is “spoke over me twice” generally safer than “interrupted,” or are both acceptable as long as they’re observable? I get stuck worrying that “interrupted” sounds a bit judgey, even though it’s factual.

If that all sounds fine, I can try my first attempt—would you prefer I go straight through a full SBI, or check each part with you as I go, just this first time? I don’t want to rush ahead and miss something.

**MentorAI:**

You’re being precise about the right edges—this part is genuinely tricky, not you overthinking.  
Slow self-check, four beats:  
1) Name a concrete moment (when/where).  
2) Filmable behavior (verbs, counts). “Interrupted” is fine if you could flag it on a recording; “spoke over me twice” is even clearer.  
3) Owned impact. Start with “I…” for your internal state or cognitive/physical effect; it’s okay to add a direct consequence you experienced (e.g., I had to circle back). Avoid drifting to big-picture judgments.  
4) Judgment leak scan—underline labels/adjectives and swap for verbs/time/counts.

Ready to write a full straight-through draft for a real moment you were in?

**elise_SBI:**

Okay, I’ll try a straight-through draft for a real moment:

In Monday’s 9am ops standup in Conference B, you joined at 9:10 and said, “Can you recap the first three items?” I felt thrown off and rushed, and I cut some details to catch up; I had to circle back later, which pushed us past time.

Is that hitting the mark? I’m second-guessing a few bits:
- Is “joined at 9:10” too nitpicky, or is that the kind of concrete timestamp that helps?
- Quoting “Can you recap…” felt safe and filmable, but does that read as overly pointed?
- On the impact, does “pushed us past time” drift into a broader meeting effect rather than my owned consequence? Should I stop at “I had to circle back later,” or is it okay to include that ripple?

If this is close, could we quickly run your four-beat self-check on it together before I try another one? I don’t want to lock in a bad habit.

**MentorAI:**

You’re scrutinizing the right edges—this is the right level of specificity, not nitpicky. Before I give feedback, predict the pushback: if I flag something in your draft, where is it most likely to be and why?

**elise_SBI:**

If you were going to flag something, I think it would most likely be in two places:

- Impact drift: “which pushed us past time” might be a step beyond my owned consequence. It kind of implies causation and edges toward a broader judgment about the meeting, right? Maybe I should stop at “I had to circle back later” so it stays squarely in my lane.

- Stacking behaviors: I mentioned both “joined at 9:10” and “said, ‘Can you recap…’.” You asked for one observable behavior, so it might be cleaner to pick the single action most connected to my impact—probably the recap request—rather than bundle both.

Smaller maybes:
- Quoting their exact words could come off a bit pointed; perhaps “asked for a recap of the first three items” is enough.
- “Joined at 9:10” is filmable, but the exact timestamp might feel accusatory—maybe “joined ten minutes after we started” would land softer, if that still passes the camera test?

Does that align with what you’d flag, or am I chasing ghosts here? Do you want me to tweak those spots now, or should I wait and hear your read first?

**MentorAI:**

Your predictions line up with what I’d likely flag—good eye. Run your four-beat self-check out loud on that draft: moment named, behavior filmable, owned impact, judgment leak scan. How does it score on each beat?

**elise_SBI:**

Running the four-beat self-check out loud—does it work if I use a simple “strong / okay with caveat / needs tweak” kind of scoring? I can adjust if you prefer a different scale.

1) Concrete moment (when/where)
- Read: “In Monday’s 9am ops standup in Conference B…”
- My take: Strong. It’s anchored with day/time/location. Part of me wonders if “Conference B” is overkill or if including it helps precision. I’m not sure which way you’d lean.

2) Filmable behavior (verbs, counts)
- Read: “you joined at 9:10 and said, ‘Can you recap the first three items?’”
- My take: Okay with caveat. Both are filmable, but I stacked two behaviors. I think I should probably pick the single action most linked to my impact (likely the recap request). Also, I’m second-guessing whether quoting the exact words is too pointed—even though it is technically camera-testable.

3) Owned impact (“I…” + direct consequence I experienced)
- Read: “I felt thrown off and rushed, and I cut some details to catch up; I had to circle back later, which pushed us past time.”
- My take: Mostly owned, needs a tiny tweak. The “I felt…” and “I cut/circle back” parts are clearly mine. The last clause—“which pushed us past time”—feels like it slips toward broader consequence and implies causation. Maybe I should stop at “I had to circle back later,” or rephrase the last bit more as my experience.

4) Judgment leak scan (labels/adjectives → verbs/time/counts)
- Potential leaks: “pushed us past time” sounds a bit blamey. “Thrown off” and “rushed” are my internal states, so I think they’re okay. “Joined at 9:10” and the quoted ask are neutral/filmable. I don’t see loaded adjectives like “rude” or “disengaged,” but I’m worried I’m missing something subtle.
- My take: Mostly clean with a small leak risk in that “pushed us past time” phrase.

Does that assessment land where you’d put it?

If it helps, I could try a light revision, but only if you want me to. Maybe something like: “Ten minutes into Monday’s 9am ops standup, you asked to recap the first three items. I felt rushed and lost my place, so I trimmed details and had to circle back later.” That drops the second behavior and the “pushed us past time” bit. But I’m not sure if moving “ten minutes into” into the moment is the right move. Should I try that, or would you rather tweak it a different way?

**MentorAI:**

That self-check lands—you’re catching the right edges. What made you choose the recap request as the single behavior over the late arrival—what cues told you it was most connected to your impact?

**elise_SBI:**

I chose the recap request because it seemed closest to the moment my impact actually happened. Right when they asked, I felt that jolt—rushed, lost my place—and I started trimming details. If they’d slipped in late but stayed quiet, I don’t think I would’ve felt the same disruption. And if they’d been on time but asked for a recap mid-item, I suspect I would’ve still had the “rushed/lost train of thought” reaction. So, I guess I was using a kind of proximity/causality check—what changed right before my experience changed.

Also, the recap request is a clean, filmable verb (“asked for a recap”), whereas “arrived late” felt more like a norm-violation that anchors the moment. I thought moving the “ten minutes in” to the situation might keep me from stacking behaviors—but maybe that’s me over-optimizing.

I’m not totally sure if that’s the best criterion though. Part of me wonders if I should have centered the late arrival because we have a team norm on punctuality, and my “pushed us past time” line was probably me trying to justify focusing on lateness—which you flagged as drift.

Does that logic track for you—using the “what preceded my impact” and the counterfactual test? Or would you have prioritized the late arrival instead? If it helps, I can try an A/B: one version with the recap ask as the behavior and one with the late arrival as the behavior—only if you think that would be useful.

**MentorAI:**

Can you lock in the recap-request version and write it exactly as you’d deliver it—two sentences, straight through?

**elise_SBI:**

Ten minutes into Monday’s 9am ops standup in Conference B, you asked for a recap of the first three items while I was walking through item two. I felt rushed and lost my place, so I trimmed details and had to circle back later.

Does that land the way you intended? I’m not sure if “item two” is too specific, or if I should have quoted the request verbatim—would you want me to adjust either of those?

**MentorAI:**

That lands; it meets the bar—no changes needed. Let’s take it up a notch: use the same move in this variation—last Thursday’s client QBR on Zoom, your director Dana posted in chat “Can you recap the first three items?” while you were presenting slide 4 to the client team. Write exactly what you’d say—two sentences, straight through.

**elise_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s client QBR on Zoom, while I was presenting slide 4 to the client team, you posted in the chat, “Can you recap the first three items?” I felt rushed and lost my train of thought, and I paused to scroll back to the earlier slides before I could continue.

Does that read the way you intended? I’m not sure if quoting the exact chat is too sharp, or if “to the client team” and “slide 4” are more detail than you want—should I pare that back, or is this the right level?

**MentorAI:**

That lands and meets the bar—anchored moment, filmable behavior (the exact chat quote is fine), and owned impact 👍. The level of detail works for a client setting; if you wanted brevity you could drop “slide 4” without changing the SBI, but it’s not necessary.

What principle will you carry forward from this second attempt when you’re giving feedback in front of clients?

**elise_SBI:**

The principle I’d carry forward is: choose the behavior closest to the moment my impact occurred and describe it in camera-testable terms—even a verbatim quote if that’s what happened—then keep the impact squarely in “I” language with just the immediate consequence I experienced, and resist expanding into broader meeting or client judgments. In a client setting, I’ll keep it concise—anchored and specific enough to be credible, but trimmed to essentials—and run the quick four-beat scan before I speak.

Does that capture the right emphasis, or is that too much? Maybe the shorter version is “proximity plus owned impact, no labels.” Your demo made that click for me; I don’t think I’d have realized quoting the chat could still be neutral without you showing it. Would it help if I tried one more client-facing version to make sure I’m really applying it?

**MentorAI:**

That captures it—your shorter mantra works: proximity to your impact, verbs/counts, “I” impact, no labels. One takeaway to keep: pre-commit to the proximity heuristic, then run the four-beat scan; if you hear yourself drifting to broader meeting judgments, trim back to your immediate consequence. What’s the next real conversation where you’ll use this?

**elise_SBI:**

The next real spot would likely be tomorrow’s 11:30am Zoom 1:1 with Priya (my peer ops lead). I want to address Monday’s 9am standup—while I was outlining the rollout plan, she started answering a question directed to me, and I felt rushed and lost my place. 

Does that seem like the right venue, or is that too small/too touchy for a 1:1? I could also use Friday’s 2pm project retro with the broader team, but I’m not sure if that’s the better context.

If this works, would you want me to draft the two-sentence version now to bring into the 1:1, or should I wait and do it closer to the meeting so it doesn’t get overworked?

**MentorAI:**

You’re reading the context well—this is a solid 1:1 topic (clear, peer-to-peer, no audience). A quick, plain two-sentence draft now helps you walk in steady; don’t over-polish. Want to write exactly what you’ll say to Priya?

**elise_SBI:**

During Monday’s 9am ops standup, while I was outlining the rollout plan, you started answering a question that was directed to me before I finished. I felt rushed and lost my place, so I trimmed some details and had to circle back later.

Does that work as-is, or is “directed to me” too interpretive? I wasn’t sure if I should have quoted the exact question, or swapped “started answering” for something like “began speaking while I was still responding” to keep it purely filmable. If you think a tiny tweak would help, I can adjust—would you want me to try another pass or rehearse this out loud once?

**MentorAI:**

You’re right to question “directed to me”—that can read as interpretive unless the question explicitly named you. Swap it for something the camera would catch: “while I was answering Alex’s question” or “while I was mid-answer,” then keep “you started speaking before I finished.” Want to say the two-sentence revision exactly as you’d deliver it?

**elise_SBI:**

During Monday’s 9am ops standup, while I was mid-answer on the rollout plan, you started speaking before I finished. I felt rushed and lost my place, so I trimmed some details and had to circle back later.

Does that land the way you intended? I’m not sure if “mid-answer” is filmable enough, or if you’d rather I say “while I was answering” to be safer. And is “trimmed some details” too vague—should I specify, like “skipped two points,” or would that start to feel nitpicky? If it’s close, would you want me to run it once more out loud to lock it in?

**MentorAI:**

This lands—the structure is solid, and you’re working at the right grain. “Mid-answer” is filmable enough; if you want plainer, “while I was answering” is great. “Trimmed some details” is fine; only add a count (e.g., “skipped two points”) if it’s true and makes your impact clearer without feeling nitpicky.

Want to say it once out loud exactly how you’ll deliver it?

**elise_SBI:**

During Monday’s 9am ops standup, while I was answering a question about the rollout plan, you started speaking before I finished. I felt rushed and lost my place, so I trimmed some details and had to circle back later.

Does that sound right as-is, or should I tweak “a question about the rollout plan” to be more/less specific? I think this flows because of your coaching, but I’m still not sure I’ll keep the tone steady in the moment—should we do one more quick run to check pacing, or is this okay to take into the 1:1?

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you’re focused on keeping the tone steady—that’s smart, and this draft is good to go as-is; “a question about the rollout plan” is fine, and if you want it tighter, “while I was answering” also works. Which exact wording will you lock in for tomorrow?

**elise_SBI:**

I’ll lock in this wording:

During Monday’s 9am ops standup, while I was answering, you started speaking before I finished. I felt rushed and lost my place, so I trimmed some details and had to circle back later.

Is that too bare without “about the rollout plan,” or is the tighter version better for a 1:1? And would you want me to keep “trimmed some details,” or say “skipped two points” if I can verify it? If it sounds okay, could I run it out loud once to check pacing and tone?

**MentorAI:**

You’re solid here—either version clears the bar, and it’s normal to want a quick pacing check. Say it once out loud exactly as you’ll deliver it tomorrow.

**elise_SBI:**

During Monday’s 9am ops standup, while I was answering, you started speaking before I finished. I felt rushed and lost my place, so I trimmed some details and had to circle back later.

Does that pacing land okay, or should I slow down a beat before the second sentence? Also, is “you started speaking” too direct—would you want that softened at all, or is it appropriately neutral here? And do I stop right there in the 1:1, or should I add a brief request only if she asks what would help next? If it’s close, could I say it once more to make sure the tone stays steady?

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you’re fine‑tuning delivery—that’s a good place to be. Try a one‑beat pause between sentences; “you started speaking” is neutral enough as‑is. If you want a light forward ask, add a third short line like, “Next time, could you wait until I finish before adding your take?” Say it once more out loud with that one‑beat pause.

**elise_SBI:**

During Monday’s 9am ops standup, while I was answering, you started speaking before I finished. [beat] I felt rushed and lost my place, so I trimmed some details and had to circle back later. Next time, could you wait until I finish before adding your take?

Did that pause feel about right, or should I hold it a touch longer? And is “could you wait until I finish” too direct—would “until I finish my answer” or “before jumping in” land softer? I think “you started speaking” is neutral, but I’m second-guessing whether there’s any judgment leaking in there. Do you want me to run it once more to lock in the pacing?

**MentorAI:**

You’re in the fine-tuning zone—good place to be. Keep the one‑beat pause; that’s enough. “You started speaking” is neutral and camera‑testable; keep it. For the request, “until I finish my answer” is the clearest and least interpretive—“before jumping in” has a slight label vibe. Give it one more run out loud with that tweak.

**elise_SBI:**

During Monday’s 9am ops standup, while I was answering, you started speaking before I finished. [beat] I felt rushed and lost my place, so I trimmed some details and had to circle back later. Next time, could you wait until I finish my answer before adding your take?

Did that land the way you’re imagining, or should I hold the pause a touch longer? And is “adding your take” the right phrase here, or would you nudge that at all? If it’s close, would you want me to run it one more time to make sure the tone stays steady?

**MentorAI:**

You’re in the fine‑tuning zone—this reads steady. For the softest, most neutral close, swap “adding your take” for “adding your perspective.” Say it once out loud with that tweak exactly as you’ll deliver it.

**elise_SBI:**

During Monday’s 9am ops standup, while I was answering, you started speaking before I finished. [beat] I felt rushed and lost my place, so I trimmed some details and had to circle back later. Next time, could you wait until I finish my answer before adding your perspective?

Did that pause feel right, or should I hold it slightly longer? And is “perspective” okay here, or does it sound a bit formal?

**MentorAI:**

You’re still in fine-tuning—this reads steady. Keep the one‑beat pause; that’s enough. “Perspective” is neutral; if it feels a bit formal in your voice, “thoughts” is a clean, equally neutral swap. Which wording are you locking in for tomorrow—perspective or thoughts?

**elise_SBI:**

I’ll lock in “thoughts,” if that works—it feels a little more natural in my voice. That still reads as neutral to you, right?

If you’re open to it, I can do one last quick read-through with that wording to make sure the tone’s steady.

**MentorAI:**

“Thoughts” is neutral and fits your voice. Go ahead and give it one final read-through exactly as you’ll deliver it, with a one‑beat pause between the sentences—ready when you are.
