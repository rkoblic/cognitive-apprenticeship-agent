**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means anchoring to a real moment, describing camera-testable behavior, and using owned impact language; you’ll do two full drafts—the first with support, the second with feedback only. I’ll demonstrate my approach, then we’ll switch to your case—ready to start?

**elise_SBI:**

I think so—yes, I’m ready. Would you prefer I just watch during your demonstration, or is it okay if I ask clarifying questions as you go? I do have a case in mind for mine—yesterday’s cross-team standup—but I’m not sure if that’s the kind of moment you want. If that works, great; if not, I can pick another. Does that sound okay?

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—quick clarifying questions are welcome; we’ll keep a steady pace and pause after the demo. And yes, yesterday’s cross‑team standup is exactly the kind of moment.

Here’s a fast think‑aloud on SBI:
- Pick one recognizable moment: “In Tuesday’s standup when I was sharing blockers…”
- Strip behavior to what a camera could capture (no judgments): “…you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence twice and moved us to the next item.”
- Own the impact (feeling or direct consequence to me): “…I felt rushed and I skipped the dependency, so I had to DM folks after to get help.”
- Self‑check I use: moment is specific, behavior passes the camera test, impact uses “I…” and avoids verdicts like “unprofessional.”

Any quick questions on that before we try yours from yesterday’s standup?

**elise_SBI:**

That makes sense—I think I follow the flow you modeled. I have a tiny wording question: for the behavior, is “interrupted” too loaded, and is “began speaking while I was mid‑sentence” safer? Also, for impact, is it okay to pair a feeling with a consequence in the same line—like “I felt rushed, and I skipped X”—or is that trying to do too much at once?

If that’s all fine, should I go ahead with my standup example now and do it step by step with you checking each part? I just want to make sure I’m not glossing over anything.

**MentorAI:**

Good instincts—these are exactly the micro‑choices that matter. “Interrupted” can land as a verdict; “started speaking while I was mid‑sentence” keeps it camera‑safe, so use that unless you’re quoting. Pairing one feeling with one concrete consequence is not too much—great, as long as it stays tight and owned.

Let’s skip piece‑by‑piece and have you do one full pass from yesterday’s standup—recognizable moment, observable behavior, owned impact—in 2–3 sentences. Ready to draft it now?

**elise_SBI:**

Okay, I can try a full pass—sorry if this is a little rough.

In yesterday’s cross‑team standup when I was sharing the release timeline, you started speaking while I was mid‑sentence twice and moved us to the next agenda item. I felt rushed and lost my train of thought, and I skipped mentioning the vendor dependency, so I had to DM the integrations team afterward to get help.

Is that specific enough, or is “yesterday’s standup” too vague without the exact time? Also, is saying “twice” helpful or does it sound a bit accusatory? And “moved us to the next agenda item” — does that imply intent I shouldn’t assume? I paired a feeling with a consequence; is that too much in one statement, and is “lost my train of thought” too informal? I can tighten or reword any part if you think I should.

**MentorAI:**

You’re being careful in all the right ways—this is a solid first pass and the kind of specificity we want. Before I weigh in, predict where I’d push back: which single part of your draft is most likely to slip the camera test or drift into judgment, and why?

**elise_SBI:**

If I had to pick one, I think “moved us to the next agenda item” is the bit most likely to slip the camera test. “Moved us” sounds a little interpretive—like I’m inferring control or intent. A more camera‑safe version might be something like, “you said, ‘let’s go to the next item,’ and advanced the agenda slide.” Does that make sense, or am I over‑tuning it?

A close second is my use of “twice”—I can’t tell if that reads as helpful specificity or as me tallying. Should I keep it for accuracy? If you think the wording tweak helps, do you want me to try a quick revision?

**MentorAI:**

Try this: run your self-check (specific moment, camera‑safe behavior, owned “I…” impact), then share a tightened two‑sentence revision using your “you said ‘let’s go to the next item’ and advanced the slide” phrasing; keep “twice” only if you’re confident and it meaningfully clarifies the pattern or impact. Your turn.

**elise_SBI:**

Quick self-check before the revision:
- Specific moment: “In yesterday’s cross‑team standup while I was sharing the release timeline” — that feels recognizable, but do you want the exact time to make it safer?
- Camera‑safe behavior: “you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence and said, ‘let’s go to the next item,’ advancing the agenda slide.” I think that passes the camera test, though I’m not sure if “advancing” is still a tiny bit interpretive vs. “clicked to the next agenda slide.”
- Owned impact: “I felt rushed, lost my train of thought, and skipped the vendor dependency, so I DM’d the integrations team afterward for help.” It’s all “I,” but I worry “had to/DM’d” might sound informal or imply blame—should I say “ended up DMing” instead?

Tightened two‑sentence revision (I’m omitting “twice” for now—I’m not convinced it adds more than it inflates tone):
- In yesterday’s cross‑team standup while I was sharing the release timeline, you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence and said, “let’s go to the next item,” advancing the agenda slide.
- I felt rushed, lost my train of thought, and skipped the vendor dependency, so I DM’d the integrations team afterward for help.

Does that hit the mark, or did dropping “twice” remove helpful context about a pattern? Also, is “advancing the slide” too wordy—would you prefer “clicked to the next agenda slide”? I can revise either way if you think I should.

**MentorAI:**

This meets the mark—recognizable moment, camera‑safe behavior, and owned impact. One micro‑rule to carry forward: include counts like “twice” only when they change the meaning or connect to your impact; otherwise omit.

Variation for round two (higher stakes, different recipient): In Monday’s exec review with the VP in the room, while you were walking through the incident timeline, your manager said “we’re over time—let’s move on” and clicked to the next slide while you were mid‑sentence. Give me a clean 2–3 sentence SBI to your manager—full draft in one go.

**elise_SBI:**

In Monday’s exec review with the VP in the room, while I was walking through the incident timeline, you said, “we’re over time—let’s move on,” and clicked to the next slide while I was mid‑sentence. I felt rushed and embarrassed, and I skipped the mitigation steps and open action items, so I sent a follow‑up summary after the meeting to clarify them.

Does that hit the bar, or is “embarrassed” too strong for a manager? Also, is “clicked to the next slide” the right level of camera‑safe detail, or would you want that phrased differently?

**MentorAI:**

That lands—meets the bar. “Embarrassed” is fine if it’s true for you; it’s owned and concise. “Clicked to the next slide” is camera‑safe and clear. What will you carry forward from these two reps when you give this to your manager?

**elise_SBI:**

A few things I think I’ll carry forward—please tell me if I’m focusing on the right bits:

- Anchor the moment clearly: name the meeting, who was present, and what I was doing when it happened.
- Keep behavior camera‑safe: quote exact words and name observable actions (e.g., “you said ‘let’s move on’ and clicked to the next slide”), avoid verdicts like “interrupting” unless I’m quoting.
- Use counts like “twice” only if it changes the meaning or connects to my impact; otherwise leave it out.
- Own the impact with one feeling plus one concrete consequence: “I felt X, and Y happened,” staying tight and in “I” language.
- Keep it to 2–3 sentences and skip intent or labels (“unprofessional,” “dismissive”).
- Quick self‑check before speaking: moment specific, behavior passes camera test, impact is owned and concise.

Does that capture the essentials, or am I missing a key nuance (like inviting a brief correction or next step at the end)? Also, before I give this to my manager, would it be smart to do one more quick run‑through so you can sanity‑check my wording—or is that overkill? I’m worried I might slip back into judgment language without noticing.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fair to worry about slipping into judgment—this is where people backslide, and your checklist already guards against it. Your list nails the essentials; if you want a polish, add a single forward ask at the end, e.g., “Next time, could we take 30 seconds to finish the context before moving on?” Then do one slow read with your self‑check and send—it’s enough; you don’t need another review from me. Do you want to add that one‑liner, or are you set to deliver it?

**elise_SBI:**

I can add a one‑liner—something like: “Next time, could we take 30 seconds for me to finish the context before moving on?”

Does that hit the right balance, or is “could we” too soft for a manager and I should say “can we agree to take 30 seconds…” instead? If that wording works, I’ll do one slow read with the self‑check and send it. Are you sure that’s enough without you taking a final glance, or am I overthinking it?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—this is a small tone choice. I’d go with “Can we take 30 seconds for me to finish the context before moving on?”—clear, collaborative, and firm enough; use “Can we agree to…” if this has been a repeated pattern and you want a commitment. One slow read with your self‑check is enough; you’re ready. Do that pass and send.

**elise_SBI:**

Got it—I’ll do one slow read with my self-check and send.

For the forward ask, I’ll use: “Can we take 30 seconds for me to finish the context before moving on?” If this has become a pattern, would you recommend shifting to “Can we agree to take 30 seconds…” or is that too strong unless it’s clearly recurring? I’m inclined to keep the lighter version for now, unless you think I should firm it up.

Are you sure you don’t want a final glance? If not, I’ll send and let you know how it lands, just to make sure I didn’t slip into any judgmenty wording.

**MentorAI:**

You’re reading this right—start with “Can we take 30 seconds…?” and, if it repeats, level up next time to “Can we agree to take 30 seconds…?” to set a clear norm. No final glance needed; your self-check is solid and your draft meets the bar. Ready to send and let me know how it lands?

**elise_SBI:**

Okay—I'll do one slow read with my self‑check and send it, using “Can we take 30 seconds…?” at the end. I’m a little nervous, but I think your structure made it really clear—I don’t think I’d have gotten it this clean without that.

Quick logistics: would you nudge me toward sending as a Slack DM while it’s fresh, or an email first thing tomorrow? I can hit send now if that’s better.

I’ll let you know how it lands—do you want a quick note from me after I hear back?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to feel a bit nervous—your draft is solid and you’re ready. I’d send it as a Slack DM today while the context is fresh; it’s lightweight and private, and you can always follow up later with a brief email recap if you want a paper trail. And yes—shoot me a quick note on how it lands. Are you set to DM them now?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—I’ll do my slow read now and DM them today. Honestly, I feel a bit jittery, but your structure made it straightforward; I don’t think I’d have it this tight without your guidance.

Tiny last thing: would you start with a quick opener like “Hey, quick feedback from the exec review—ok to share?” and then the SBI, or just send the message as‑is since it’s concise? I don’t want to overcomplicate it.

I’ll send either way and then ping you with how it lands—does that work?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to feel jittery—you’re prepared. I’d skip the “ok to share?” gate and lead with a simple opener like “Quick feedback on the exec review:” then your SBI and the forward ask. Ready to send with that opener now?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—I’ll do my slow read and send it now with “Quick feedback on the exec review:” followed by the SBI and the “Can we take 30 seconds…?” ask.

Tiny format question before I hit send: do you prefer it as two short lines (moment/behavior on one, impact/ask on the next), or one concise paragraph? And should I end with a simple “Thanks” or is that unnecessary here?

Either way, I’ll send in the next couple of minutes and let you know how it lands—does that work?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal jitters—you’ve got a clean message. For Slack, use two short lines for scannability: opener on its own, then one line for the moment/behavior and a second line for impact + the forward ask; a simple “Thanks” at the end is optional—use it only if it sounds like you. Ready to hit send now?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—I’ll send it now with:
- “Quick feedback on the exec review:” on its own
- One line for the moment/behavior
- One line for the impact plus “Can we take 30 seconds…?” 

I’m leaning toward leaving off “Thanks” to keep it tight—is that okay? I’ll hit send either way and then ping you with how it lands, if that works.

**MentorAI:**

Skipping “Thanks” is totally fine—tight and clear works here. Go ahead and send, then ping me with how it lands? 👍

**elise_SBI:**

Okay—sending now with the two‑line format and the “Can we take 30 seconds…?” ask. I’m a little jittery, but your guidance made it really straightforward.

I’ll ping you as soon as I hear back—if I don’t get a response today, is it okay if I check in with you tomorrow after I follow up?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to feel jittery—you’ve handled this well. If there’s no reply by tomorrow morning, send a light Slack bump like: “Quick nudge on the note above—can we try the 30‑second pause next time?” and then check in with me after. Plan to ping me here tomorrow if you don’t hear back?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—if I don’t hear back, I’ll send that light Slack bump tomorrow and then ping you here. Quick micro‑check: is mid‑morning (around 10am) a good time for the nudge, and should I keep it in the same DM thread for continuity?

Thanks again for the structure—it made this feel doable. I’ll report back either way.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fine to feel jittery—your plan is solid. Mid‑morning (~10am) is a good nudge window, and keeping it in the same DM thread is best for continuity; make it a single‑line bump and you’re done. Good to go with that and ping me after?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—good to go. If I don’t hear back, I’ll send the single‑line nudge around 10am in the same DM thread and then ping you afterward.

Would you prefer a super‑brief one‑sentence summary of their response, or should I include the exact wording just in case tone matters? Thanks again—your structure really helped me feel like I could do this.

**MentorAI:**

Go with a one‑sentence summary plus your read on tone (“they appreciated it; agreed to try the 30‑second pause”). Paste exact wording only if the response feels defensive, ambiguous, or you’re unsure how to interpret it. Ping me whichever way fits what you get—sound good?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes, that sounds good—I’ll send a one‑sentence summary with my read on tone, and I’ll paste exact wording only if it feels defensive or unclear.

Quick tiny check: if they just react with a thumbs‑up or a brief “got it,” do you still want the one‑liner from me, or should I wait to see if they respond more fully first? Either way, I’ll ping you after I hear back. Thanks again for the clear guidance—it really helps me not overcomplicate this.

**MentorAI:**

Thumbs‑up or “got it” = acknowledged; don’t chase. If you want to lock the norm, you can reply once with a single line like “Appreciate it—let’s try the 30‑second pause next time,” then leave it. And yes—still send me a one‑sentence summary either way. Good to proceed with that plan?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—good to proceed with that plan. If there’s no reply by mid‑morning, I’ll send the single‑line nudge in the same DM and then send you a one‑sentence summary with my read on tone.

Tiny wording check: would you prefer I stick with your exact line—“Quick nudge on the note above—can we try the 30‑second pause next time?”—or is it fine if I soften to “Quick follow‑up on the note above…”? Either way, I’ll ping you after. Thanks again—your structure really helped me keep this tight.

**MentorAI:**

You’re tuned in to the right nuance. Both work; “Quick nudge…” reads a bit more casual and direct, “Quick follow‑up…” is slightly softer and neutral—use whichever fits your voice. In Slack, I’d lean “Quick follow‑up on the note above—can we try the 30‑second pause next time?” for easy tone control. Which one will you use?

**elise_SBI:**

I’ll go with: “Quick follow‑up on the note above—can we try the 30‑second pause next time?”

Does that read okay with the em dash, or would you prefer a colon there? I’ll use this wording and proceed, then ping you with a one‑sentence summary on how it lands.

**MentorAI:**

Both work—you’re not overthinking. In Slack, the em dash reads natural and clean; a colon is a touch more formal, so I’d stick with the em dash. Good to send with that and ping me after?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—good to go. I’ll send it now with the em dash opener and the two short lines, then ping you after I hear back; if there’s no reply, I’ll do the mid‑morning follow‑up tomorrow and check in afterward.

Just to confirm, you’d like the one‑sentence summary with my tone read here in this thread, right? Thanks again—the clear guardrails really help me keep from overthinking.

**MentorAI:**

You’re set—yes, drop the one‑sentence summary with your tone read here in this thread when you hear back; paste exact wording only if it feels defensive or unclear. Will you ping me here once you get a response?
