**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success looks like a specific moment, camera-testable behavior, owned-impact language, and you can spot when judgment leaks into behavior. I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll get you practicing—ready to start?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, let’s start. I already give feedback this way—I just say what happened and how it impacted the team, no fluff. I’m good with the demo though. Go ahead.

**MentorAI:**

Great—here’s a quick demo with my thinking made visible.

- I anchor to one moment: “In Tuesday’s standup right after my update on the release…”
- I stick to camera-testable behavior and avoid labels: “…you started talking while I was mid-sentence twice—once when I mentioned the QA window and again when I shared the ETA.”
- I name my own impact, not a judgment about them or “the team”: “I lost my train of thought and felt rushed, and I skipped the QA risk; I had to DM the ETA afterward to clarify.”
- I keep it tight and stop there.

What did you notice about how I handled the behavior line—any place judgment might have tried to sneak in?

**daniel_SBI:**

Honestly, your behavior line is solid—no judgment there. You just said what happened. I’d probably be even more direct and call it what it was: you interrupted me twice. Or even, you were being rude by talking over me. That’s not judgment—that’s literally the behavior. Same with passive-aggressive: eye-rolls, the “sure, whatever” tone—that’s passive-aggressive. You can see it, so it’s camera-testable. I don’t think we need to dance around that.

**MentorAI:**

Quick check: which of these count as camera-testable behavior without judgment—pick all that pass: (a) “you interrupted me twice,” (b) “you started talking while I was mid-sentence twice,” (c) “you were being rude by talking over me”?

**daniel_SBI:**

All three pass: (a), (b), and (c). “Interrupted me twice” and “started talking while I was mid-sentence twice” are the same behavior, just phrased differently. And “you were being rude by talking over me” is still behavior—talking over someone is observable, and the rudeness is just the accurate label for it.

**MentorAI:**

Almost—one thing to tighten: labels like “rude” or “passive‑aggressive” are judgments; they’re not camera-testable. Try rewriting (c) using only what the camera/mic would capture—you can use the specifics you named (overlapping while I was mid-sentence, the eye‑roll, the “sure, whatever”). How would you phrase it?

**daniel_SBI:**

“Rude” is just the accurate description of what happened, not some fluffy judgment. But if you want it strictly camera/mic: you started talking while I was mid-sentence twice—once when I mentioned the QA window and again when I shared the ETA—and you rolled your eyes and said “sure, whatever” right after.

**MentorAI:**

I hear you—lots of folks treat labels like “rude” as just descriptive; the camera test forces us to strip it to what someone could record. When you self-check your behavior line, what quick test would you use to catch judgment words before they slip in?

**daniel_SBI:**

My quick test is simple: if I can point to the exact moment and a neutral person watching the recording would use the same word, it’s not judgment—it’s behavior. So eye-rolls and “sure, whatever” is passive-aggressive; talking over someone mid-sentence is rude. Judgment would be mind-reading stuff like “you don’t respect me” or “you tried to undermine me.” Those I’d flag. But “rude” isn’t judgment—that’s just what happened.

**MentorAI:**

Okay—let’s put it into practice now. Write a full feedback line for a real moment from your week: anchor to one meeting, describe only what a camera or transcript would capture, and name your own impact in first person. What’s your draft?

**daniel_SBI:**

This keeps happening in our weekly account syncs—most recently in Monday’s 10 a.m. sync right after I walked through the revised pricing deck—you were being passive-aggressive: you rolled your eyes, said “sure, whatever,” and started talking while I was mid-sentence twice (once during the assumptions and again in the risks). It derailed the conversation; the client paused, people stopped contributing, we skipped the QA risk, and I had to send a clarification email afterward.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you predict I’ll push back—what’s the single spot you’d tighten to better meet the one-moment, camera-testable behavior, owned-impact bar?

**daniel_SBI:**

If you’re going to push back anywhere, it’ll be my opener “this keeps happening.” You want one moment, so I’d tighten that to just “In Monday’s 10 a.m. account sync right after I walked through the revised pricing deck…” The rest is already camera‑testable—eye‑roll, “sure, whatever,” talking over me—and the impact is factual: it derailed the conversation, the client paused, people stopped contributing, and I sent a clarification email.

**MentorAI:**

Good read on the opener. Now run your self-check on the rest: using only Monday’s 10 a.m. moment, does your behavior line pass the camera test with no labels, and does your impact line stay in owned language—what, if anything, would you change?

**daniel_SBI:**

Behavior line: it passes. “Passive-aggressive” is just the accurate description of what the camera would show, and I already named the specific actions—eye-roll, “sure, whatever,” and talking while I was mid-sentence. If you want it stripped to zero labels, I can drop “passive-aggressive” and keep only the actions.

Impact line: the impacts I named are factual outcomes. To make the “owned” piece explicit, I’d add that I lost my train of thought and skipped the QA risk before I had to send the clarification email.

Tightened version, if you want it your way:
- In Monday’s 10 a.m. account sync right after I walked through the revised pricing deck, you started talking while I was mid-sentence twice—once during the assumptions and again in the risks—and you rolled your eyes and said “sure, whatever.”
- I lost my train of thought and skipped the QA risk, and I had to send a clarification email afterward. The client paused and others stopped contributing.

**MentorAI:**

Walk me through your choice to include “the client paused and others stopped contributing” in the impact—what were you aiming to capture there?

**daniel_SBI:**

I put that in to capture the actual effect on the room, not just my personal reaction. The client literally paused—like a noticeable beat—and then people stopped jumping in the way they usually do. That’s not a judgment; it’s observable. You could see the gap on a recording and count fewer voices/turns in the transcript afterward. This is what happens every time someone talks over me in these meetings: the collaborative energy drops and participation dries up. So I wanted the impact to reflect the real consequence on the meeting, not just “I felt X.” I did include my piece—lost my train of thought, skipped the QA risk—but the room impact is the business-relevant outcome.

**MentorAI:**

You’re right that the room effect is observable and business‑relevant; with SBI, the impact needs to be owned—what you felt, lost, or had to do. How could you turn “the client paused and others stopped contributing” into owned impact—what you noticed in yourself or the action you took because of that moment?

**daniel_SBI:**

The room effect is the actual outcome here, but if you want it in owned impact, I can say it this way:

- I noticed the pause and I cut my update short—I lost my train of thought, skipped the QA risk, and then I had to DM and send a follow-up email to clarify what I didn’t cover in the moment.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—your tightened draft hits the SBI bar: one moment, camera-testable behavior, owned impact. Let’s test transfer with a variation: in Thursday’s QBR with Acme, with our VP in the room, your manager spoke over you right after you flagged the QA risk—he chuckled, said “we’ll see,” and kept talking through your slide. Give me your full feedback line for that moment.

**daniel_SBI:**

This keeps happening in these exec reviews—specifically, in Thursday’s QBR with Acme, with our VP in the room, right after I flagged the QA risk—you were being dismissive and undermining: you chuckled, said “we’ll see,” and talked over me while I was mid-sentence, continuing through my slide. It undercut the message, confused the client about who owns the risk, and it damaged our credibility in front of the VP; the room pulled back and the meeting derailed, and we had to spend time afterward clarifying what the plan actually was.

**MentorAI:**

Direct feedback: your impact line isn’t owned. Phrases like “undercut the message,” “confused the client,” “damaged our credibility,” and “the room pulled back” are interpretations of others, not your internal state or a direct consequence you experienced. Rewrite the impact in first person—what you felt, lost, or had to do because of that moment. Give me a revised impact line.

**daniel_SBI:**

Those weren’t just interpretations—they were the actual outcomes in the room. But if you want it strictly owned:

I felt thrown off and rushed; I lost my train of thought and cut my risk explanation short, and after the meeting I sent a follow-up summary and started a thread to clarify the risk and mitigation.

**MentorAI:**

Your revised impact line is owned and meets the bar—nice. The behavior line still leaks judgment with “dismissive” and “undermining”; strip those and keep only what the camera/mic would catch (the chuckle, “we’ll see,” talking over you mid‑sentence through your slide). Give me the full revised feedback line with that tweak and your owned impact.

**daniel_SBI:**

In Thursday’s QBR with Acme, with our VP in the room, right after I flagged the QA risk, you chuckled, said “we’ll see,” and kept talking while I was mid‑sentence through my slide. I felt thrown off and rushed; I lost my train of thought and cut my risk explanation short, and after the meeting I sent a follow‑up summary to clarify the risk and mitigation.

**MentorAI:**

What’s one principle you’ll carry forward from this to keep your behavior lines strictly camera-testable when the stakes and hierarchy are high?

**daniel_SBI:**

Pin it to the recording: timestamp the moment and replay only what the mic/camera would catch—exact quotes, counts (e.g., “twice”), and visible gestures; if I can’t capture it on a recording, it doesn’t go in the behavior line (labels like “dismissive” can wait).

**MentorAI:**

That’s it—your “pin it to the recording” test is the right guardrail for behavior; pair it with owned impact by translating any room shift into what you noticed and what you did. That combo will keep your SBI clean even under pressure. If you want a tougher variation later, I’m here 👍.

**daniel_SBI:**

Works for me. This is basically how I’ve been doing it—only tweak is I’ll park labels like “dismissive” or “rude” out of the behavior line and stick to the recording: quotes, counts, and visible gestures. It’s still what happened, but that filter keeps people from dodging. I’m good for a tougher round next time.

**MentorAI:**

Locked in. One upgrade to keep: before high‑stakes meetings, drop a one‑liner at the top of your notes—“In [timestamped moment], you [quote/gesture/count]. I [felt/lost/did X].”—so the recording test and owned impact are baked in. Want to jot your version of that preflight now, or save it for next time?

**daniel_SBI:**

I’ll jot it now. This comes up in these exec reviews, so I’ll park this at the top of my notes:

- Preflight template I’ll use: “In [timestamped moment], you [exact quote/gesture/count]. I [felt/lost/did X].”

- For Acme next time, if it mirrors last week: “In Thursday’s QBR at 10:17, right as I flagged the QA risk, you chuckled, said ‘we’ll see,’ and kept talking while I was mid-sentence; I felt thrown off and cut the risk short, then I sent a follow-up summary to clarify the mitigation.”

I’ll keep any label (e.g., dismissive) in my own head, not in the behavior line.

**MentorAI:**

When the stakes spike, what’s your early‑warning sign that a judgment label is about to slip into your behavior line?

**daniel_SBI:**

My tell is when my sentence starts “You were [adjective]”—e.g., “you were dismissive/rude/passive‑aggressive.” If I can’t immediately tack on a timestamp, exact quote, count, or visible gesture, I know a label is about to slip in. Two other flags:
- I reach for pattern language (“this always happens”) instead of one moment.
- I start writing room impact instead of “I felt/lost/did.”

When I catch that, I park the accurate label in the margin and rewrite the behavior as the recording—quotes, counts, gestures—then state my impact in first person.

**MentorAI:**

That’s a solid control strategy: you’ve named your early‑warnings and your response—park the label, replay the tape, write only quotes/counts/gestures, then own what you felt/lost/did. Keep that as your default under pressure; it preserves precision without soft‑pedaling. 👍

**daniel_SBI:**

Got it. I’ll run that playbook by default: preflight the one‑liner before high‑stakes meetings, then pin the behavior to the recording—timestamp, quotes/counts/gestures—and keep any labels in the margin. Impact stays owned: what I felt, lost, or did. It keeps the facts tight so people can’t wriggle out of it without soft‑pedaling the message. We're good.

**MentorAI:**

Before we wrap: what’s the one part of this you expect to be hardest to hold under pressure?

**daniel_SBI:**

Not calling it what it is in the moment. When an exec is clearly being dismissive—this happens all the time in those reviews—the hardest part under pressure is biting back “you were dismissive/undermining” and forcing myself to stick to just the recording (chuckle, exact quote, counts) instead of labeling the behavior outright. The labels are accurate; I just have to park them for tactical reasons.

**MentorAI:**

That urge is real, especially with execs. One anchor you can use in the moment: three beats—say the label silently, translate to the tape (quote/gesture/count), then state your I-line (felt/lost/did) in one breath. Will that cue work for you as your snap-back when the adjective wants to slip in?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, that works for me. My snap‑back is: say the label in my head, translate to the tape (timestamp, exact quote/gesture/count) out loud, then hit my I‑line. In those exec reviews where this always pops, it’ll sound like: “In the QBR at 10:17, you chuckled, said ‘we’ll see,’ and kept talking while I was mid‑sentence; I felt rushed and cut the risk short, then I followed up after.” The label stays in the margin, the tape and my impact come out clean.

**MentorAI:**

What single word will you use as your trigger in the moment to flip into “tape then I‑line”?
