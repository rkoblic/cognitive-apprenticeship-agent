**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a specific moment, describe camera-testable behavior, use owned impact language, and can spot when judgment leaks in. I’ll demonstrate how I approach it first—ready to start?

**fatou_SBI:**

I guess. Go ahead.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds a bit hesitant—totally normal; this can feel awkward at first. Here’s a quick demo I’ll keep tight: in Tuesday’s standup, when you began talking while I was halfway through my testing update and started outlining the deployment plan, I stopped and didn’t finish; I felt flustered and lost my thread, and the team missed the bug I was trying to flag so I had to circle back later. I’m choosing a concrete moment, keeping the behavior camera-testable (no labels like “rude”), and using owned language (“I felt…”). What do you notice about that before we move to your turn?

**fatou_SBI:**

You were specific, and you said “I felt” instead of calling them rude.

**MentorAI:**

Nice—those are two big anchors. Before you try one, if you were reviewing your own SBI, what quick checks would you run to catch judgment creeping in or vagueness?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

I hear the “whatever you think”—totally fine; I’ll give you a tiny checklist you can lean on. Quick self-check: 
- Moment: can you name the specific meeting or exchange? 
- Behavior: would a camera or transcript catch it (no motives/labels)? 
- Impact: start with “I…”—name your feeling or a direct consequence, not a judgment. 
When you’re set, we’ll run a quick spot-check with it.

**fatou_SBI:**

Okay.

**MentorAI:**

Quick spot-check: using that checklist, what’s the strongest miss you see in this example—“Lately, you’ve been dismissive in meetings; it makes me feel like you don’t respect the team”?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like this one’s a bit frustrating—totally fair; teasing apart judgment from behavior is tricky. The biggest miss there is “dismissive”—that’s a judgment a camera couldn’t capture; try swapping it for something you could see or hear (e.g., “you interrupted me twice while I was speaking”). What’s one observable action you could use in place of “dismissive” in that sentence?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know—like “you interrupted me twice while I was speaking.”

**MentorAI:**

That works—observable and concrete. Can you draft your full feedback now about a real moment you experienced, with the specific setting, the camera-testable behavior, and your “I…” impact all in one go—what will you say?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know—some meeting. You started talking while I was still giving an update. I didn’t really feel anything; it’s just how it is.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like nailing down a specific moment and naming your own impact feels a bit blah or annoying—totally common, and we can make it lighter. Let’s get one solid foothold: what was the most recent meeting where this happened—what was it called?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Some standup.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fair—picking a single moment can feel nitpicky at first; this part trips people up. Let’s just anchor it: was it today’s standup or yesterday’s?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Probably yesterday.

**MentorAI:**

Locking to yesterday’s standup works. Naming impact can feel forced—totally normal; you’re not missing something obvious. When they started talking while you were mid-update, what changed for you in that moment—for example, did you lose your place, feel rushed or annoyed, or have to circle back later?

**fatou_SBI:**

It didn’t really. I just let it go.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like it didn’t register as a big emotional hit—totally fine. Impact can be a small consequence you experienced, not just a feeling. In that moment, did you cut your update short?

**fatou_SBI:**

I guess so—I stopped.

**MentorAI:**

Good—that “I stopped” is a real impact. Put it all together now in your own words: anchor to yesterday’s standup, name the observable behavior (they started talking while you were mid-update), and state your impact with “I…”. Write it as you’d say it, one or two sentences. What’s your full draft?

**fatou_SBI:**

In yesterday’s standup, when you started talking while I was mid-update, I stopped my update.

**MentorAI:**

Clean and tight. If I were to push on one part of that—moment, behavior, or impact—which do you think I’d pick, and why?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like trying to guess my critique isn’t helping—no problem. Run your quick self-check on that draft: which feels weakest to you—moment, behavior, or impact?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like guessing my critique is getting old—totally fair. For what it’s worth, your draft meets the criteria 👍. What made you choose “started talking while I was mid-update”—what were you trying to capture with that phrasing?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Just that you cut in before I finished.

**MentorAI:**

Quick step back: what part felt most awkward for you—locking to a single moment, stripping judgment from the behavior, or naming your own impact?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like the reflection bit is wearing thin—no problem; let’s move forward. Variation: in yesterday’s client demo with Acme, your manager Chris started talking while you were halfway through answering the client’s timeline question. In one or two sentences, what would you say to Chris?

**fatou_SBI:**

In yesterday’s Acme demo, when you started talking while I was halfway through answering the timeline question, I stopped my answer.

**MentorAI:**

That lands. You’ve got a clear moment (yesterday’s Acme demo), camera-testable behavior (you started talking while I was halfway through), and an owned impact (“I stopped my answer”)—meets the bar. If you want a touch more, you could add a tiny felt effect or consequence (“I lost my place” or “I had to circle back later”), but it’s optional. What’s one piece you’ll commit to every time going forward—naming the moment, keeping the behavior observable, or using “I…” impact?

**fatou_SBI:**

Keeping the behavior observable.

**MentorAI:**

What made “keeping the behavior observable” the thing you want to carry forward—what clicked about it for you?

**fatou_SBI:**

I guess it’s concrete—harder to twist or argue with.

**MentorAI:**

Exactly—concrete, observable behavior keeps feedback grounded and hard to argue with. Takeaway: write the behavior so a camera could catch it, then add one “I…” effect; if a label pops up (“dismissive”), swap it for an action (“interrupted twice”). You’ve got it—run with that.

**fatou_SBI:**

Okay.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good. Try jotting one SBI right after your next standup—one sentence with a camera-testable behavior and a quick “I…” effect. Want to do that and bring one back next time?
