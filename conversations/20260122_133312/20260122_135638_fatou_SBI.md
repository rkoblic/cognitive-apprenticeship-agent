**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework in a professional context. Success looks like you completing two full attempts that hit a real moment, camera-testable behavior, and owned-impact language—I’ll model first, then we’ll practice. Ready to start?

**fatou_SBI:**

I guess.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds a bit hesitant—that’s common with feedback work; we’ll take it step by step. I’ll model a quick example, thinking out loud: I pick a real moment—Tuesday’s standup—then keep the behavior camera-testable: you started speaking while I was mid-sentence twice (not “you were rude”). I use owned impact: I lost my train of thought, felt flustered, and we skipped a blocker. Put together: “In Tuesday’s standup, when I was giving my update you jumped in twice while I was still talking; I lost my train of thought and felt flustered, and my blocker didn’t get surfaced—can we try letting me finish before jumping in?” What did you notice in that example before we try yours?

**fatou_SBI:**

You were specific. And you said how it affected you.

**MentorAI:**

Right—those are two big anchors. If you were doing a quick self-check on your own draft, what simple tests would you use to confirm the behavior is camera-testable and the impact is owned by you?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fair—this part can feel fuzzy; you’re not missing something obvious. Two quick checks I use: for behavior, the camera test—would a neutral video clearly show what I’m describing? for impact, the I-test—can I start it with “I felt…” or “I ended up…” and it’s my experience (not a judgment like “it was unprofessional”). Want me to give you a sample line to rate with those before we draft yours?

**fatou_SBI:**

Sure. If you want.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—quick check to warm up. Try the camera test and the I-test on this: “In Thursday’s planning meeting, when you were dismissive and didn’t respect the process, I felt it was unprofessional and it hurt team morale.” Pass or fail?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. You tell me.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds uncertain—this distinction is genuinely tricky, so you’re not missing something obvious. Taking just the behavior clause “when you were dismissive and didn’t respect the process,” could a neutral camera capture “dismissive” or “didn’t respect the process” without interpretation—yes or no?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Probably not.

**MentorAI:**

You’re on the right track—those words are judgments, not visuals. What’s one thing you literally saw or heard that led you to “dismissive,” phrased as an action a camera would capture?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Just the tone. Like… dismissive.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fair—tone is real, and this is the bit that trips people up. In SBI, we anchor tone in something the camera would catch; the simplest is quoting exact words. Do you remember any specific phrase they used that came off as dismissive to you?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t remember. Maybe just “whatever.”

**MentorAI:**

Nice—that’s a concrete quote a camera could catch. What did “whatever” come right after in that meeting?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. After my update, I guess.

**MentorAI:**

Good—that’s a workable moment. Let’s use Thursday’s planning meeting, right after your update when they said “whatever.” Draft your full feedback in 2–3 sentences: name that moment, describe what you saw/heard (camera-testable), and say your impact in I-language—write it as you’d actually say it to them. Can you give me that full draft?

**fatou_SBI:**

In Thursday’s planning meeting, after my update you said “whatever.” It didn’t really affect me—it’s just how it is.

**MentorAI:**

You’ve got a clear moment and a concrete quote—that’s solid. Naming the impact can feel vulnerable; lots of folks instinctively downplay it. Where do you think I’ll push back against the criteria right now?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

I hear the “whatever” vibe—naming impact can feel exposed; that’s a common move to downplay it, not a failure. Run the I-test on your second sentence and replace it with one specific I-statement about what happened for you in that moment (emotion, physical effect, or direct consequence). What’s a true line you can put there starting with “I felt…” or “I ended up…”?

**fatou_SBI:**

I felt like it didn’t matter.

**MentorAI:**

You’re close—“I felt like it didn’t matter” points at the situation, not your internal state. In that moment, what specifically showed up for you—an emotion (frustrated, embarrassed, deflated), a physical jolt (stomach drop), or a direct consequence (I lost my thread or stopped sharing)?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. I lost my train of thought.

**MentorAI:**

That’s owned and specific—nice. Put it all together now: same moment and quote, then add your impact as “I lost my train of thought” in 2–3 sentences as you’d actually say it. Can you give me that full draft?

**fatou_SBI:**

In Thursday’s planning meeting, right after my update you said “whatever.” I lost my train of thought.

**MentorAI:**

That lands: real moment, camera-testable quote, and owned impact. Before I weigh in, where do you think I’d still push—if anywhere?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—you hit the bar 👍. Try a higher‑stakes variation: in Monday’s all‑hands dry run, right after your update a senior peer from another team said “whatever—let’s move on” with directors in the room. Write the feedback you’d say to that peer in 2–3 sentences.

**fatou_SBI:**

In Monday’s all‑hands dry run, right after my update you said “whatever—let’s move on” with the directors in the room. I lost my train of thought and felt embarrassed, and I ended up skipping a key point.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar: a clear moment, camera‑testable behavior via the exact words, and owned impact (emotion plus consequence). It’s concise and professional—that lands. What’s the one principle from this you’ll carry forward when you draft feedback on your own?

**fatou_SBI:**

Keep it camera‑testable.

**MentorAI:**

That’s the spine: anchor to a real moment, name something a camera would catch (often a quote), then add a simple I-impact—if you hear yourself using a label like “dismissive,” swap it for the words you actually heard. Nice work today 👍

**fatou_SBI:**

Okay.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good. Anything else you want to practice with SBI right now?

**fatou_SBI:**

No. I’m good.

**MentorAI:**

Alright—good work today. You’ve got the camera‑testable spine; you’re set. Catch you next time.

**fatou_SBI:**

Okay.

**MentorAI:**

Got it. When you want another rep, bring a real moment and we’ll sharpen it—deal?
