**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success looks like anchoring to a real moment, describing camera-testable behavior, using owned impact language, and noticing when judgment creeps in. I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll move to your practice—ready to start?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, let’s go. I’m ready. Just so you know, I already give feedback this way—I call out what I see. If someone’s being passive-aggressive or undermining the team, I say it directly. But sure, show me your version.

**MentorAI:**

Got it. Here’s a quick think‑aloud model so you can see how I sharpen direct feedback with SBI:

- In Tuesday’s standup right after your update on ticket 184, while I was summarizing the API risk, you spoke over me twice and said “let’s not rehash basics” to the group.  
- I felt shut down and lost my train of thought; I held back the dependency risk, and we spent 20 extra minutes later clarifying it.  
- Can we try letting the speaker finish before jumping in? I can signal when I’m wrapping so you can respond right away.

What I’m watching: anchor to a specific moment, use quotes/counts so it’s camera‑testable, and name my actual feeling or consequence; I avoid labels like “undermining” in the behavior line. If you were checking your own draft, what would you look for to catch judgment creeping into the behavior piece?

**daniel_SBI:**

Honestly, I’d just make sure I’m stating what actually happened, not watering it down. If someone was being passive‑aggressive or undermining, I’d say that—because that’s the behavior. I’d check that I can point to specifics (eye‑rolling, the dismissive “sure, whatever” tone, interrupting, side comments). If those are there, then calling it passive‑aggressive isn’t “judgment,” it’s accurate. So for me, the check is: can I back it up with clear examples anyone in the room would recognize? If yes, then it’s not judgment—it’s just the facts.

**MentorAI:**

Your push for specifics is solid—direct lands best when it’s anchored in what happened. In SBI, though, labels like “passive‑aggressive” are still judgments even if you can cite examples; we keep the edge by naming the actions, not the motive. How would you rewrite this so the behavior is camera‑testable: “In Tuesday’s standup after my update, you were passive‑aggressive”?

**daniel_SBI:**

“In Tuesday’s standup after your update, you rolled your eyes, spoke over me twice while I was summarizing the API risk, and said ‘let’s not rehash basics’ in a dismissive tone—that’s passive‑aggressive.” Anyone watching a recording would see that.

**MentorAI:**

In that line, what piece would a camera not capture—the part that’s your interpretation rather than observable?

**daniel_SBI:**

A camera would capture all of it—the eye roll, speaking over me twice, the exact words “let’s not rehash basics,” and the tone on the audio. “That’s passive‑aggressive” isn’t me guessing at intent; it’s the factual description of those behaviors as a pattern. So there isn’t a non‑camera piece there. If anything, the only thing a camera doesn’t show is what they were thinking, but I’m not claiming their thoughts—I’m describing what happened.

**MentorAI:**

I hear you—wanting to be precise and direct is a strength, and this labels-vs-actions line is genuinely subtle. Ready to try a full draft from a real moment you want to address—anchored to a specific meeting, behavior as only what someone could see/hear (skip labels like passive‑aggressive/dismissive), then how it landed for you?

**daniel_SBI:**

Situation: In Monday’s sprint planning at 10:05, right after I finished walking through the client change request—and this is something that happens pretty much every planning—you jumped in as we were shifting to dependencies.

Behavior: You were being passive‑aggressive. You rolled your eyes, smirked, and cut me off twice; you said “let’s not rehash basics” to the room and made side comments to Sam; your tone was dismissive the whole time.

Impact: It undermined the meeting. People stopped engaging, we lost about 25–30 minutes later clearing up the dependencies, and it hurt team morale. I felt like my input was dismissed.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, what’s the one phrase in your draft you think I’ll push on as judgment creeping into the behavior?

**daniel_SBI:**

You’ll call out “you were being passive‑aggressive.” I get that you see it as judgment, but in this case it’s an accurate description of the visible pattern—eye‑rolls, smirk, cutting me off, side comments, and the “let’s not rehash basics” line. That’s not speculation; it’s naming what happened.

**MentorAI:**

I hear the push—you value being precise and direct, and this labels-vs-actions line is genuinely subtle. Run the camera test on your behavior line: keep only what a camera/mic would capture verbatim, and tell me which words you’d strike or rephrase.

**daniel_SBI:**

Most of it already passes the camera test. Here’s the behavior line trimmed to only what the camera/mic would capture:

- “You rolled your eyes, smirked, and cut me off twice while I was summarizing the API risk. You said, ‘let’s not rehash basics’ to the room, and you leaned toward Sam twice and made quiet side comments.”

What I’d strike or rephrase:
- Strike: “you were being passive‑aggressive” (that’s the label you’ll flag).
- Rephrase: “dismissive tone” -> remove the judgment word and let the quote/interruptions speak for themselves, or make it neutral like “said it in a low, flat voice.”
Everything else—eye rolls, smirk, cutting me off twice, the exact quote, and turning to Sam for side comments—stays because a recording would capture it.

**MentorAI:**

The behavior trim you made lands—camera/mic only. 👍 One thing to tighten now: your impact has judgments baked in—“it undermined the meeting” and “it hurt team morale” aren’t owned. Try swapping those for what you actually felt or the concrete consequence you experienced (e.g., what you did/didn’t do, time lost), and keep anything others‑focused only if it’s observable. Can you rewrite the impact line with owned feeling/consequence only?

**daniel_SBI:**

Impact (owned): I felt shut down and frustrated; I lost my train of thought and held back the dependency risk in the moment. We then spent about 25 minutes later clarifying that dependency because I hadn’t raised it during the standup.

Just to be clear, this wasn’t only about my feelings—it also slowed the meeting down, which is exactly what that shows.

**MentorAI:**

That impact rewrite lands—owned feeling plus a concrete consequence covers the “slowed the meeting” point without judging others. One thing to tighten now: your situation mixes a single moment with a pattern (“this happens pretty much every planning”), which breaks the single‑moment anchor—common slip. Trim it to just the recognizable moment. Give me your tightened situation line with no pattern reference.

**daniel_SBI:**

Monday’s sprint planning at 10:05, right after I finished walking through the client change request—same point this typically happens when we shift to dependencies.

**MentorAI:**

You trimmed it, but the pattern snuck back in with “same point this typically happens.” For a single‑moment anchor, cut that clause and stop at the shift: “In Monday’s sprint planning at 10:05, right after I finished walking through the client change request, as we shifted to dependencies.” Drop in your tightened situation line (or paste your full updated SBI with behavior/impact as you revised) so we can confirm it’s there.

**daniel_SBI:**

Here’s the full SBI with the situation tightened, plus the specifics we discussed:

- Situation: In Monday’s sprint planning at 10:05, right after I finished walking through the client change request, as we shifted to dependencies—this is where it typically goes off track—you jumped in.

- Behavior: You were being dismissive. You rolled your eyes, smirked, cut me off twice while I was summarizing the API risk, said “let’s not rehash basics” to the room, and leaned toward Sam twice to make quiet side comments.

- Impact: It undermined the meeting—people pulled back—and we spent about 25 minutes later clarifying the dependency I held back. I felt shut down and frustrated and lost my train of thought in the moment.

**MentorAI:**

Walk me through your choice to include “you were being dismissive” in the behavior line—what were you trying to accomplish with that label, and what (if anything) do you think would be lost if we cut it?

**daniel_SBI:**

I added “you were being dismissive” as the headline that names the pattern the specifics point to. It compresses the cluster—eye roll, smirk, cutting me off twice, “let’s not rehash basics,” side comments—into the accurate descriptor everyone in the room would recognize. It sets the stakes and makes it clear this wasn’t just a single interruption; it was a way of showing up.

What I’m trying to accomplish with the label:
- Signal the overall pattern and tone so the person doesn’t pretend it was a one‑off blip
- Keep us from litigating each micro‑action like “Was it really two interruptions?” while ignoring the obvious gist
- Convey the seriousness and expectation shift—this isn’t just mechanics, it’s how you’re treating a teammate in the moment

What’s lost if we cut it:
- The headline clarity; the receiver can cherry‑pick (“I only interrupted once”) and sidestep the bigger issue
- The tone/valence of the behaviors taken together—audio would capture that, but without the label they can feign confusion about why it’s a problem
- Efficiency—I have to say ten words to communicate what “dismissive” conveys instantly

I’m not guessing their motive; I’m naming the clear behavioral pattern. Removing the label blunts that and invites hair‑splitting instead of fixing the behavior.

**MentorAI:**

I get why you want a headline—labels feel efficient and force the pattern into focus—but they also invite argument about the label instead of the actions. You can keep the headline force without judgment by “time‑boxing and clustering”: name the short window, then stack counts, quotes, and who heard it. Example shape (not words to copy): “In the next 60–90 seconds, you [action A] once, [action B] twice, said ‘[quote],’ and turned to [person] for two side comments.”

Try that: rewrite just your behavior line with a time‑boxed cluster—no adjectives, only what a mic/camera would capture. What’s your one‑sentence version?

**daniel_SBI:**

Over the next minute, you rolled your eyes once, cut me off twice while I was summarizing the API risk, said “let’s not rehash basics” to the room, and made two side comments to Sam.

**MentorAI:**

That time-boxed behavior line lands. Bring it together—share your full updated SBI in one go: the single-moment situation (no pattern reference), the one-sentence behavior you just wrote, and the owned impact you drafted. Then we’ll pressure-test it. Ready to paste the full draft?

**daniel_SBI:**

- Situation: In Monday’s sprint planning at 10:05, right after I finished walking through the client change request, as we shifted to dependencies.

- Behavior: Over the next minute, you rolled your eyes once, cut me off twice while I was summarizing the API risk, said “let’s not rehash basics” to the room, and made two side comments to Sam.

- Impact: I felt shut down and frustrated; I lost my train of thought and held back the dependency risk in the moment. We then spent about 25 minutes later clarifying that dependency because I hadn’t raised it during the standup, and it undermined the meeting.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back against the criteria here—single moment, camera‑testable behavior, and owned impact with no judgment?

**daniel_SBI:**

You’ll probably push on “it undermined the meeting” in the impact and say it isn’t owned. From my side, that’s just the factual outcome—if we had to spend 25 minutes later fixing what didn’t get surfaced, the meeting was undermined.

The rest meets the criteria:
- Single moment: “Monday’s sprint planning at 10:05, right after the change request, as we shifted to dependencies” is a clean anchor.
- Camera‑testable behavior: counts, quote, who heard it—no adjectives.
- Owned impact: “I felt shut down,” “I lost my train of thought,” “I held back the dependency risk,” plus the concrete consequence (25 minutes later).

If you’re going to push anywhere, it’s that final “undermined the meeting” clause. I still see it as factual, not judgment.

**MentorAI:**

You predicted the right spot—“it undermined the meeting” isn’t owned, and your 25‑minute consequence already makes that point. Cut that final clause; the rest meets the bar. Paste your revised SBI so we can lock it.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar—clean anchor, camera‑testable behavior, owned impact. 👍

Second rep, higher stakes: In last Thursday’s client QBR at 2:10, right after you finished the scope‑change walkthrough and shifted to dependencies, your manager Jordan spoke over you twice, said “let’s not rehash basics” and “we’re short on time—move on” to the room, and posted “take it offline” in Zoom chat while DM’ing Sam. Give me your full SBI for that moment.

**daniel_SBI:**

- Situation: In last Thursday’s client QBR at 2:10, right after I finished the scope‑change walkthrough and as we were shifting to dependencies—this is the point where this usually goes sideways—Jordan jumped in.

- Behavior: Jordan was being dismissive and undermining. He spoke over me twice, said “let’s not rehash basics” and “we’re short on time—move on” to the room, posted “take it offline” in the Zoom chat, and DM’d Sam during my section while I was still addressing the client’s dependency question.

- Impact: It undermined the presentation and confused the client; they pulled back on questions and the tone got tense. It hurt our credibility in the room. We then spent about 30–40 minutes after the call untangling the dependency risk the client didn’t fully hear. I felt undercut in front of the client.

**MentorAI:**

Direct feedback: your anchor drifts—cut “this is the point where this usually goes sideways.” Your behavior line includes judgments—drop “dismissive and undermining” and keep only what a mic/camera would capture. Your impact isn’t owned in several spots—replace “undermined the presentation,” “confused the client,” “hurt our credibility,” and “tone got tense” with your feeling and concrete consequences; if you name client reaction, make it observable (e.g., they asked no further questions after X). Keep the 30–40 minutes of follow‑up and “I felt undercut.” Can you revise and paste the full SBI?

**daniel_SBI:**

- Situation: In last Thursday’s client QBR at 2:10, right after I finished the scope‑change walkthrough and as we shifted to dependencies.

- Behavior: Over the next minute, Jordan spoke over me twice, said “let’s not rehash basics” and “we’re short on time—move on” to the room, posted “take it offline” in the Zoom chat, and DM’d Sam while I was addressing the client’s dependency question.

- Impact: I felt undercut and thrown off; I lost my place and didn’t finish explaining the dependency risk. After “move on,” the client asked no further questions on dependencies, and we spent about 30–40 minutes after the call clarifying that risk. And yes, that undermined the presentation.

**MentorAI:**

Almost there—one thing to tighten 🔧: the last sentence “that undermined the presentation” is a judgment. Your owned feeling plus the concrete consequence already make the point. Cut that line and paste your final SBI.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar—clear anchor, camera/mic-only behavior, and owned impact with concrete consequences. 👍 What was the single shift in your approach that changed the most from your usual style, and how will you know you’re holding that line in future drafts?

**daniel_SBI:**

The single shift was cutting the headline label from the behavior line and replacing it with a time‑boxed cluster of counts and quotes. That’s the biggest change from my usual “name the behavior” style.

How I’ll know I’m holding the line next time:
- Behavior check: One tight sentence, time‑boxed (e.g., “over the next minute”), with counts, exact quotes, and who heard it. Zero adjectives or motive words—no “dismissive,” “undermining,” “passive‑aggressive.”
- Camera/mic test: If someone replayed the meeting, the line would read like a transcript they can’t deny. If the only possible pushback is “I didn’t do X,” not “I wasn’t being Y,” I’m on target.
- Adjective/motive scrub: Delete any descriptors a camera can’t capture (tone labels, intent words). Keep only actions, counts, quotes, and recipients.
- Impact check: Start with “I felt/I did or didn’t,” then a concrete consequence (time lost, rework). No “team morale,” “credibility,” or “undermined the meeting.”
- Situation check: One moment with a timestamp; no “this always happens” language.

I’m still going to call patterns over time, but in the behavior line I’ll stick to camera/mic facts so the feedback is undeniable and lands.

**MentorAI:**

That’s the move: use a time‑boxed, count‑and‑quote cluster as your “headline”—it carries the pattern without labels, so the feedback is hard to argue and easy to act on. If your behavior sentence could sit in a transcript and still tell the story, you’re holding the line. 👍

**daniel_SBI:**

Got it. The “time‑boxed, count‑and‑quote” sentence gives me the headline without the label, and it keeps the edge. That fits how I like to operate—straight facts, no wiggle room.

I still think labels like “dismissive” are accurate, but this version makes it basically irrefutable and faster to act on. I’ll stick to:
- One‑moment anchor
- One sentence of camera/mic behavior with a time window, counts, quotes, and who heard it
- Owned impact plus the concrete consequence

If my behavior line reads like it could drop straight into the transcript and still tell the story, I’m holding the line.

**MentorAI:**

That’s it: make your “headline” a time‑boxed count‑and‑quote sentence that could drop straight into the transcript, then pair it with owned impact—your feedback stays sharp and hard to dispute. You’ve kept the edge and removed the wiggle room. 👍
