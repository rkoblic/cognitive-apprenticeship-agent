**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework—anchoring to a real moment, describing observable behavior (no judgments), and naming your own impact in owned language. I’ll demonstrate how I approach it, then we’ll shift to your real situation and practice. Ready to dive in?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, let’s do it. Honestly this is how I already give feedback—say what happened and how it affected the team. Like with Marcus, this happens all the time: he’s passive-aggressive in meetings and it tanks morale. But go ahead and show me your approach and I’ll line mine up with it.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—you already give direct feedback; we’ll sharpen it to hit SBI cleanly. Here’s how I’d do it: “In Tuesday’s standup while we were reviewing tickets, you spoke over Sarah twice while she was explaining her blocker, sighed, and said ‘whatever.’ I felt tense and lost my thread, and I skipped part of my update to keep things moving.” I anchored to one meeting, stuck to camera‑testable behaviors, and used owned impact (what I felt and did) instead of labels like “passive‑aggressive” or “tanked morale.” Self‑check I use: one clear moment, verbs you could film, and “I felt/I did” impact. What do you notice before we try yours with Marcus?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, that’s fine as an example. You anchored it and listed the actions. But you left out the actual behavior: he was being passive-aggressive. Sighing, “whatever,” talking over Sarah—that is passive-aggressive, so calling it that is just being accurate and saves the runaround. And with Marcus it’s not a one-off Tuesday thing—this happens basically every meeting. Also, the impact wasn’t just you feeling tense; it objectively derailed the standup and people shut down. That’s the real effect that matters, not just how someone felt. So I’m aligned on the structure, but I’d say it plainly.

**MentorAI:**

I hear you—naming the pattern feels honest and efficient, and the recurring effect on the team matters. Quick check, though: run the camera test on “In Tuesday’s standup, you were passive‑aggressive”—what would the footage need to show for that to be indisputable? What do you see when you try to film that?

**daniel_SBI:**

The footage would make it obvious. You’d see him roll his eyes, interrupt Sarah mid-sentence twice, let out a loud sigh, and say “whatever” in a sarcastic tone while leaning back with that dismissive look. That’s literally what passive-aggressive is. Anyone watching the tape would call it that. And you’d also see the impact—people go quiet, shoulders drop, fewer hands go up. So yes, it’s camera-testable and not up for debate.

**MentorAI:**

I get why you want to name the pattern—and the behaviors you listed are exactly the raw material; we’ll anchor to one clear moment first so it’s undeniable, then you can point to recurrence. Pick a specific recent meeting with Marcus (e.g., last Thursday’s standup) and draft your feedback in 2–3 sentences that stick to what someone could see/hear and your own impact. Will you write your version now?

**daniel_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s standup—and honestly this happens in basically every meeting—you were being passive-aggressive: you rolled your eyes, interrupted Sarah twice, sighed, and said “whatever” in a sarcastic tone. That behavior undermined the meeting, people shut down, and it hurt team morale.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push against the SBI criteria in your draft?

**daniel_SBI:**

You’ll probably go after three things:
- The pattern call‑out (“this happens in basically every meeting”)—you’ll say anchor to one moment. But it is an ongoing issue, and it’s accurate to name that.
- The label “passive‑aggressive”—you’ll say that’s a judgment. I see it as the actual behavior, and the footage (eye‑rolls, interruptions, sigh, sarcastic “whatever”) makes that obvious. It’s efficient to name it.
- The impact—you’ll want “I felt/I did.” I think the real impact is objective: it undermined the meeting and people shut down. You can see that on camera, so it’s not just my reaction.

**MentorAI:**

You’re right—that’s exactly where I’d press. Run your draft through this self-check: one clear moment, filmable verbs only, and impact in “I felt/I did” language. What’s the first edit you’d make based on that?

**daniel_SBI:**

First edit: I’ll drop the “this happens in basically every meeting” so it’s anchored to one moment. The rest is already filmable and accurate.

Revised:
In last Thursday’s standup, you were being passive-aggressive: you rolled your eyes, interrupted Sarah twice, sighed, and said “whatever” in a sarcastic tone. That undermined the meeting and people shut down.

**MentorAI:**

You tightened the anchor—good. I hear you want to be plain and efficient by naming the pattern. If you drop the “passive‑aggressive” label and rely only on the filmable actions, does anything essential get lost for Marcus?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah—dropping the label loses the core of what actually happened. The eye‑rolls, interruptions, sigh, and sarcastic “whatever” are the data points; the behavior is passive‑aggressive. If I don’t name it, he can nitpick each item (“I just sighed once,” “I was joking”) and dodge the pattern and intent. Calling it what it is is more accurate and efficient, and it makes clear why it objectively undercut the meeting and morale. I’d keep the label and the specifics.

**MentorAI:**

I get why you want to name the pattern—your goal is to make it undodgeable. Let’s tighten one thing that’s keeping this from clean SBI: the impact. Right now it’s about the room; SBI needs your owned impact—what you felt or did in that moment. In that same Thursday standup, what’s a true “I” impact you can name (emotion, physical reaction, or what you changed/omitted)? Add one sentence starting with “I…” and weave it into your draft.

**daniel_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s standup, you were being passive-aggressive: you rolled your eyes, interrupted Sarah twice, sighed, and said “whatever” in a sarcastic tone. That undermined the meeting—people shut down. I was frustrated and cut my update short to keep things moving.

**MentorAI:**

You’re close. The one thing keeping this from clean SBI is the label “passive‑aggressive”—it’s a characterization layered on top of the filmable actions. Try a version that cuts that phrase and starts straight with the actions: “In last Thursday’s standup, you rolled your eyes, interrupted Sarah twice…” Will you rewrite your draft that way and share it?

**daniel_SBI:**

Sure—here it is without the label:

In last Thursday’s standup while we were reviewing tickets, you rolled your eyes, interrupted Sarah twice mid‑sentence, let out a loud sigh, and said “whatever” in a sarcastic, dismissive tone. That derailed the meeting—people went quiet and participation dropped. I felt frustrated and cut my update short to keep things moving.

**MentorAI:**

This is very close. One tighten: “derailed the meeting” is a judgment and not owned—keep your observation by using your own words (“people went quiet and participation dropped”) or anchor it with “I saw…”, then keep your “I felt/I did.” Will you rewrite that middle clause and share the revision?

**daniel_SBI:**

Revised:
In last Thursday’s standup while we were reviewing tickets, you rolled your eyes, interrupted Sarah twice mid‑sentence, let out a loud sigh, and said “whatever” in a sarcastic, dismissive tone. I saw people go quiet and participation drop after that. I felt frustrated and cut my update short to keep things moving.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—anchored, filmable, and owned impact. Now for a variation with higher stakes and a different recipient: In Monday’s client demo with Northwind, while the client was explaining a blocker, your manager Priya interrupted twice with “we’re short on time,” took over the screen share to move ahead, and said “we’ll circle back.” Draft your 2–3 sentence feedback to Priya using SBI.

**daniel_SBI:**

In Monday’s Northwind demo—and this has been happening in recent demos—you were dismissive and steamrolled the client: you cut them off twice with “we’re short on time,” took over the screen share to push ahead, and said “we’ll circle back.” That shut the client down, undermined their confidence, and hurt the relationship by signaling we weren’t taking their blocker seriously.

**MentorAI:**

Anchor’s solid and you included concrete actions—good. The leak is in “dismissive” and “steamrolled,” which are judgments layered on top of the filmable behavior; cut those and start straight with the actions. Give me a revision with that fix.

**daniel_SBI:**

In Monday’s Northwind demo—and this has been happening in recent demos—you cut the client off twice with “we’re short on time,” took over the screen share to move ahead, and said “we’ll circle back.” That shut the client down, undermined their confidence, and hurt the relationship by signaling we weren’t taking their blocker seriously.

**MentorAI:**

Direct feedback: two misses. 1) Stick to the single moment—drop “this has been happening in recent demos.” 2) Your impact isn’t owned; “shut the client down/undermined their confidence/hurt the relationship” judges outcomes and others’ feelings. Replace that with what you observed and your own impact (what you felt or did in the moment). Make those fixes and share the revision.

**daniel_SBI:**

In Monday’s Northwind demo, you cut the client off twice with “we’re short on time,” took over the screen share to move ahead, and said “we’ll circle back.” I saw the client disengage—he stopped mid‑explanation, leaned back, and didn’t contribute on that topic again. I felt concerned and skipped my follow‑up questions to keep us on time.

**MentorAI:**

Solid anchor, clear actions, and you included owned impact (“I felt…I skipped…”). Two quick trims to meet the bar: drop the inferred motive “to move ahead,” and cut the label “disengage”—just keep the filmable signs (he stopped mid‑explanation, leaned back, didn’t contribute again). Make those tweaks and share the final version?

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar—anchored to a real moment, filmable behaviors, and owned impact (what you saw and what you felt/did). Clear and usable 👍. Looking back, what’s the one principle you’ll carry forward the next time you give feedback?

**daniel_SBI:**

Call it what it is, then make it undodgeable—name the real behavior plainly and back it with one camera-test moment and a quick “I felt/I did” impact. That way it’s direct and efficient, and they can’t shrug it off as a joke or a one-off.

**MentorAI:**

Takeaway: Your directness lands best when it’s tape-then-I—one concrete, filmable moment first, then your owned impact; if you need to note a pattern, add it after the moment without labels. That keeps it accurate, efficient, and hard to dodge.

**daniel_SBI:**

Works for me. I’ll lead with the tape—one concrete moment you could replay—then a quick “I felt/I did.” If I need to flag the pattern after, I’ll add “I’ve seen the same eye‑roll/sigh combo in the last two standups” without labels. That keeps it direct and undeniable, and if they try to brush it off as a joke, I can point back to the footage and the change in my behavior.

**MentorAI:**

Lock it in: lead with tape‑then‑I—swap any label for two filmable verbs, then your “I felt/I did”; if you need to flag a pattern, name the same actions repeating across moments, not a trait. You’ve got the move.

**daniel_SBI:**

Locked. I’ll lead with tape‑then‑I: swap any label for two filmable verbs (“you rolled your eyes and sighed”), then add my owned impact (“I felt X, I did Y”). If I note a pattern, I’ll name the same actions repeating across moments (“same eye‑roll/sigh in the last two standups”), not a trait. That keeps it blunt, accurate, and hard to dodge.

**MentorAI:**

Takeaway: keep your bluntness, anchor it—lead with one replayable moment, swap labels for filmable verbs, then your “I felt/I did”; if you flag a pattern, cite the same actions repeating, not a trait. You’re set.

**daniel_SBI:**

Got it. I’ll keep it blunt and anchored: lead with one replayable moment, swap any label for two filmable verbs, then my “I felt/I did.” If I flag a pattern, I’ll cite the same actions repeating, not a trait. That keeps it objective and hard to dodge.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds locked—tape‑then‑I, no labels, pattern as repeated actions. You’ve got the move. Anything else you want to tune before you use it?

**daniel_SBI:**

I’m good. My tune is speed and punch: two sentences max—“In X, you [two filmable verbs]. I saw [visible effect], I felt [emotion] and did [action].” If they try to dodge, I’ll add a second replayable moment: “Same [actions] in [date/time].” I’ll also keep audible tone when it’s clear—“you said ‘whatever’ in a sarcastic tone” is recordable—and I’ll note room effects as observations (“I saw people go quiet”), not “it derailed.” That keeps it blunt and hard to wiggle out of.

**MentorAI:**

You’ve locked in a clean, blunt SBI—tape‑then‑I, no labels, and patterns as repeated actions. To put it into motion, what’s the first real conversation you’ll use this on and when?

**daniel_SBI:**

Marcus—right after next Tuesday’s 10:00 a.m. standup. This is an ongoing thing in pretty much every meeting, so I’ll lead with one replayable moment from that standup and then note the same eye‑roll/sigh/interrupt combo repeating. I’ll catch him immediately after the huddle, around 10:20, so it’s fresh.

**MentorAI:**

When you’re in the moment Tuesday, what’s your cue to avoid labels and stick to tape‑then‑I?
