**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a real moment, describe observable behavior, and name your own impact—and you’ll do two full attempts. I’ll demonstrate my approach first, then we’ll practice—ready to start?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—ready, I think. Would it be okay if I jot notes and maybe pause you with clarifying questions if I’m not sure I’m tracking? And should I have a specific scenario in mind while you demo, or just watch first? I have one from Monday’s standup that might work, but I’m not sure if it’s the right kind of example. I’m happy to follow your lead.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fine to take notes and jump in with clarifying questions; that helps. And your Monday standup example is exactly the kind we’ll use—hold it for practice.

Here’s my quick demo, thinking out loud in four moves:
1) Pick a real moment: “In Tuesday’s standup…”
2) Name camera-testable behavior: “…you started talking while Sam was mid-sentence twice.”
3) Own the impact: “…I felt tense and rushed, and I held my update—I didn’t raise my blocker until later in Slack.”
4) Watch the leak points: I swap labels like “interrupting” or “dominated the meeting” for what a camera would capture, and I keep impact to my feeling or direct consequence, not their intent or character.

A simple self-check I run: real moment, camera-testable behavior, owned impact—yes to all three before I send. What’s one spot in that draft where judgment could’ve slipped in if I hadn’t been careful?

**elise_SBI:**

Maybe the behavior line is where judgment could’ve slipped in—if you’d said “you interrupted Sam” instead of “you started talking while Sam was mid-sentence,” that feels more like a label than something a camera would capture. Is that what you meant? Or am I overthinking the word “interrupted”? And even the “twice” part—I think it’s helpful specificity, but I worry it could sound a bit accusatory? Does that still pass your self-check?

**MentorAI:**

You’ve got it: “interrupted” is a label; “started talking while Sam was mid‑sentence” passes the camera test. And “twice” is fine—it’s specific and neutral—use it if you’re confident, and let your owned impact carry the tone. Ready to draft your Monday standup feedback in full—real moment, camera‑visible behavior, and your impact—all in one go?

**elise_SBI:**

I can try—if you don’t mind sanity‑checking it after? Here’s a first pass:

- In Monday’s standup at 9am on Zoom, when I was sharing the ops update,
- you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice—once to answer Jordan’s question and once to add the release date,
- and I felt flustered and rushed. I skipped my escalation in the moment and only posted it later in Slack.

Does that hit the three checks? I’m not sure if “started talking while I was mid‑sentence” is too loaded—should I just say “began speaking” or is that splitting hairs? Also, is naming Jordan helpful specificity or too much detail? And “twice” feels useful, but it doesn’t read accusatory, right? I’m a little unsure if “flustered” is too emotional or if saying I “only posted it later” sounds like I’m blaming them for my delay. Should I tweak this one or would you rather I try a second version to compare?

**MentorAI:**

You’re noticing the exact leak points people wrestle with—good sign you’re doing the work, not overthinking. Before I weigh in, predict: if I were to push on one part of your draft, which line would it be, and why?

**elise_SBI:**

If I had to guess—maybe you’d push on the behavior line, specifically the “once to answer Jordan’s question and once to add the release date” part. I worry that gets close to explaining the why and brings a third person into it, which might invite debate or shift focus off the camera-test part. Is that the kind of leak you watch for?

A softer second guess is my impact: “I skipped my escalation and only posted it later.” It’s owned, but does it imply “because you talked over me” even if I didn’t say that? I can tighten either piece—should I try a quick revision, or am I over-fixing this?

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you’re being careful—this part is genuinely tricky, and you’re noticing the right leak points. Run the self-check on your draft—real moment, camera‑testable behavior, owned impact—and tell me which, if any, doesn’t clearly pass.

**elise_SBI:**

Okay, running the three-part check on my draft:

- Real moment: “In Monday’s standup at 9am on Zoom, when I was sharing the ops update.” I think that’s concrete and anchors in time/place. Maybe it’s a bit detailed, but it seems to pass… right?

- Behavior: “You started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice—once to answer Jordan’s question and once to add the release date.” The core—“started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice”—feels camera‑testable. The add‑ons about Jordan and the release date might be where judgment or intent creeps in (or at least invites debate). So this one doesn’t clearly pass for me.

- Impact: “I felt flustered and rushed. I skipped my escalation in the moment and only posted it later in Slack.” That’s owned and describes my action, but I worry it could read like “because you did X.” I think it mostly passes, but I’m not 100% sure.

So if any piece doesn’t clearly pass, it’s the behavior line because of the extra “why”/context. Should I trim it to just “you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice,” or is that oversimplifying? I can try a quick revision if that’s helpful.

**MentorAI:**

You’re right—this part is tricky; what were you hoping to accomplish by naming Jordan and the release date in the behavior line?

**elise_SBI:**

I was trying to make it easier for them to remember the exact moments and to signal I noticed the content wasn’t malicious—it was answering a question and adding info. I thought naming “Jordan’s question” and “the release date” would keep it concrete and maybe reduce defensiveness.

But I worry that tips me from “camera view” into managing their reaction or inviting debate—like we could get stuck on whether Jordan’s question warranted jumping in, or whether the release date was urgent. That feels a little off for the behavior line, right?

Would it be cleaner to:
- keep it minimal: “you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice,” or
- use neutral anchors without the “why”: “…twice, during Jordan’s question and during the release‑date discussion”?

I’m not sure which is closer to best practice. If you want, I can try a trimmed version now—unless you think I’m over-editing.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not over‑editing—this is exactly the level of precision that makes SBI land. Go with your second option: keep “twice” and use neutral anchors (“…during Jordan’s question and during the release‑date discussion”) without explaining motives. Can you put the whole feedback in one clean pass with that tweak?

**elise_SBI:**

Okay—here’s the cleaned-up version with that tweak:

- In Monday’s standup at 9am on Zoom, while I was sharing the ops update,
- you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice—during Jordan’s question and during the release‑date discussion,
- and I felt flustered and rushed, so I held back my escalation in the moment and only posted it later in Slack.

Does that read as camera‑testable and owned? I’m not totally sure if “mid‑sentence” is too pointed—would “while I was speaking” be softer without losing specificity? And is “flustered” too emotional, or is that the kind of honest impact that helps? Also, the “so I held back…” part—does that accidentally imply “because you did X,” even though I’m trying to keep it about my response?

If this is close, would you like me to tweak wording, or should I try a second full attempt to make sure I’m actually getting it and not just following your lead?

**MentorAI:**

That lands—your wording is camera-testable and your impact is owned; this meets the bar for your first attempt. Let’s raise the stakes: give upward feedback to your manager about yesterday’s client kickoff on Zoom, where they started speaking while you were answering a client’s question—draft the full message in one pass. Ready to take that swing?

**elise_SBI:**

I can take a swing—if you’re okay sanity‑checking it after?

- In yesterday’s client kickoff on Zoom at 2pm with the Meridian team, during Dana’s question about post‑launch support,
- you began speaking while I was mid‑answer, and our audio overlapped for a few seconds. It happened twice—once during that Q&A and again on the pricing slide while I had started to respond to a follow‑up,
- and I felt rushed and trimmed my response. I left out the SLA qualifier in the moment and worried it might look to the client like we weren’t fully coordinated, so I added the qualifier in the chat afterward.

Does that pass your three checks? I’m not sure if “mid‑answer” is too pointed—should I say “while I was speaking” instead? And is “our audio overlapped” clear enough without sounding blamey? Also, naming Meridian/Dana—helpful specificity or too much detail? I tried to keep the client read as my worry rather than a statement of what they thought, but does that still imply causation? If this is close, I can tweak wording—or would you rather I try another version to compare?

**MentorAI:**

That lands 👍 It passes all three checks: specific moment, camera‑visible behavior, and owned impact. “Mid‑answer”/“our audio overlapped” are neutral and clear; naming Meridian/Dana helps anchor; “I worried…” stays owned rather than claiming the client’s view.

What’s one wording choice or principle from this draft that you’ll carry forward when you’re giving feedback under pressure?

**elise_SBI:**

I think the one I’d try to hold onto under pressure is “use camera‑testable wording”—swapping labels for what someone could literally see or hear. Like saying “our audio overlapped for a few seconds” instead of “you interrupted.” It seems to keep judgment out and helps me stay neutral… I think?

I’m not totally sure if that ever comes off as too soft or euphemistic, though—like, would I end up minimizing the issue? Your framing made it feel straightforward here, but on the spot I worry I’d fumble it. Would a little cue like “camera, not character” be a decent reminder, or is that cheesy? Do you want me to try a one‑line version out loud to see if it sticks?

**MentorAI:**

Keep “camera, not character”—paired with a clear, owned consequence—as your default; that combo reads as direct, not soft.

**elise_SBI:**

That helps—“camera, not character” plus an owned consequence feels like something I can actually remember under pressure. Could I try a one‑breath version to see if I’ve got it?

Maybe: “In yesterday’s kickoff, you started talking while I was mid‑answer twice; I felt rushed and I left out the SLA qualifier, then added it in chat afterward.”

Does that read as direct and still neutral? I’m not sure if “mid‑answer” is too sharp and “twice” too clipped, and the “I felt rushed and I left out…” might sound causal even though it’s owned. Would “while I was speaking” be better? If this is close, do you want me to do one more quick rep on a different scenario to make sure it sticks?

**MentorAI:**

That one-breath version reads direct and neutral as-is; you’re not soft‑pedaling. If “mid‑answer” feels sharp in your mouth, “while I was speaking” is an equally clear swap, and “twice” is fine if accurate. Quick check under pressure: say it once in an even voice—if you don’t feel the pull to add justification, it’s strong enough. Your call on the wording—pick what you’ll actually say smoothly when it counts.

**elise_SBI:**

Could I try that “even voice” check once with the softer wording, and you can tell me if it lands?

“In yesterday’s kickoff, you started talking while I was speaking twice; I felt rushed and left out the SLA qualifier, then added it in chat afterward.”

I think I said it evenly without wanting to justify… maybe? I can’t tell if “twice” sounds a little clipped out loud, or if the “I felt rushed and left out…” still comes off as causal even though it’s owned. Did that read direct and neutral to you?

Also, I’m pretty sure I only managed that because of your “camera, not character + owned consequence” framing—it gave me something to hold onto. Do you want me to do one more quick rep on a different scenario to make sure it sticks, or is that overkill?

**MentorAI:**

That sounded even and it lands—direct and neutral; “twice” doesn’t come off clipped, and your “I felt rushed and left out…” stays owned, not blamey. You don’t need another rep. Keep this as your on‑the‑spot anchor: camera, not character + one owned consequence, then the even‑voice check—if it passes, ship it. Anything you want to capture in your notes before we close?

**elise_SBI:**

I jotted a few things—I think these are the essentials, but can you tell me if I’m missing anything important?

- Default under pressure: “Camera, not character” + one owned consequence, then do the even‑voice check. If I don’t feel the urge to justify, ship it.
- Three-part self-check before sending: real moment; camera‑testable behavior; owned impact.
- Behavior wording: avoid labels/intent (“interrupted,” “dominated,” “because…”). Use what a camera would catch: “started talking while I was speaking,” “our audio overlapped,” include “twice” if accurate, and neutral anchors (“during Jordan’s question…”).
- Impact wording: start with “I felt…” and name one direct consequence I controlled (e.g., “I left out the SLA qualifier/held the escalation”). Avoid “you made me feel…”
- Common leak points to watch: sneaking in motives, predicting others’ perceptions as fact, or implying causation (“because you…”). Trim extras if I hear myself explaining.
- If I wobble: strip behavior back to the camera test and keep one clean consequence; reread in an even voice.

Would a tiny one‑liner template like “In [real moment], you [camera behavior]; I felt [X] and I [owned consequence]” be okay to keep in my notes, or is that too reductive? And should I add a reminder about a collaborative close (like “Could we align on cues for handoffs?”), or is that getting ahead of the SBI core?

Honestly, this all clicked because of your “camera, not character” framing—I don’t know if I’d have distilled it that way on my own. Do these notes look right, or should I adjust anything before I lock them in?

**MentorAI:**

Your notes are tight—nothing critical missing. The one‑liner template is fine as a pocket cue; use it to draft, then tweak for nuance. A collaborative close is optional and comes after your impact as a forward‑looking request in one short line (e.g., “Could we align on handoff cues next time?”). If you had to pick just two words to glance at under pressure to trigger the right move, which would you choose?

**elise_SBI:**

Maybe “Camera consequence.” It reminds me to describe what a camera would catch and then name one owned consequence—short enough to glance at without overthinking.

If that feels too cryptic, a backup could be “Even voice” for the send check. But I think “Camera consequence” keeps me focused on the core move. Does that work, or would you nudge me toward something like “Camera owned” instead? I’m happy to write whatever you think will stick best for me.

**MentorAI:**

“Camera consequence” works—keep it. I’d skip “Camera owned”; “consequence” cues you to name the specific action you took, not just a feeling, which keeps it sharper. If you want a tiny send‑check under it, “even voice” is solid. I’ll leave you to lock that in.

**elise_SBI:**

Okay—I’ll lock it in as:
- Camera consequence
- even voice (as the send‑check)

And I’ll keep the pocket template handy: “In [moment], you [camera behavior]; I felt [X] and I [owned consequence].” I think that will keep me from over-explaining, but… can you sanity‑check that this same pattern still holds in more sensitive conversations too? Or are there any cases where you’d advise a different first move?

I really feel like the “camera, not character” framing is what made this click for me—I don’t think I would’ve distilled it that cleanly on my own. Would it be okay if I send you a quick note after I try this in my next standup, just to make sure I’m applying it the way we intended?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—the same pattern holds in sensitive conversations; keep SBI and add two guardrails when stakes or power dynamics are high: ask brief permission up front (“Could I offer a quick note on handoffs?”) and close with a forward-looking request (“Could we align a cue for when one of us jumps in?”); if live timing feels off, move it to a 1:1. You’re welcome to send me a short note after your next standup. What tiny tweak will you add to your “Camera consequence” cue for high‑sensitivity moments?

**elise_SBI:**

Maybe I add a tiny topper: “Ask bookends.”

So under pressure it becomes:
- Camera consequence
- ask bookends
- even voice

As a cue to myself: open with a brief permission (“Could I offer a quick note on handoffs?”) and close with a forward request (“Could we align a cue for when one of us jumps in?”).

If “ask bookends” feels too cute, I could use “permission/request” instead. Does that match what you had in mind, or would you nudge me to phrase it differently? I can try a one‑breath version with the bookends if that would help me cement it.

**MentorAI:**

“Ask bookends” works if it’s sticky for you; if you want plainer, “permission + request” is clearer and points to the exact two moves. Pick the phrasing you’ll actually recall under pressure—the sequence stays the same. Want to try your one‑breath version with the bookends to lock it in?

**elise_SBI:**

Okay—here’s a one‑breath version with the bookends:

“Could I offer a quick note on handoffs? In yesterday’s kickoff, you started talking while I was speaking twice; I felt rushed and left out the SLA qualifier, then added it in chat afterward; could we align a cue for when one of us jumps in next time?”

Does that land as direct and neutral? I can’t tell if “twice” sounds a bit clipped out loud, or if “while I was speaking” should be “mid‑answer” or even “our audio overlapped” to stay strictly camera. And with the upward angle, is “could we align” the right tone, or should it be “can we align” to feel more collaborative? If this is close, do you want me to try one more pass to smooth the wording, or am I over‑tuning it? I think your framing is what made it feel doable—I’m not sure I’d keep it this clean without that.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—direct and neutral; “twice” doesn’t sound clipped, and your even voice carries it. If you want the behavior to be utterly unarguable, swap in “our audio overlapped for a few seconds” (it’s the most camera); “while I was speaking” is still fine if it’s what you’ll say smoothly. “Could we align” vs “can we align” both work—pick what feels natural in your mouth. Which behavior phrasing are you going to lock into your notes?

**elise_SBI:**

I’ll lock “our audio overlapped for a few seconds” in my notes, since it’s the most camera‑clean. If it feels awkward in my mouth under pressure, I’ll swap to “while I was speaking.”

Does that make sense, or would you rather I standardize on one phrasing for muscle memory? I’m probably only landing on that because of your prompt—happy to adjust if you think I’m overcomplicating it.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overcomplicating it. For muscle memory, pick one default and stick with it—lock “our audio overlapped for a few seconds” as your go‑to, keep “while I was speaking” as a quiet backup you’ll only use if the default feels awkward in your mouth. Do two out‑loud reps with the even‑voice check; if it trips you, swap to the backup and make that your default for now rather than juggling both. Go ahead and lock your default phrasing in your notes now.

**elise_SBI:**

Locking this in my notes now:

- Behavior default: “our audio overlapped for a few seconds”
- Backup (only if the default trips the even‑voice check twice): “while I was speaking”
- Cue stack: Camera consequence + permission/request + even voice
- Pocket template: “In [moment], you [camera behavior]; I felt [X] and I [owned consequence].”

Is “for a few seconds” specific enough, or should I name it (“about 3–4 seconds”)? I don’t want it to sound clinical or nitpicky.

Also, do you want me to do the two out‑loud reps with the even‑voice check right now, or should I run them on my own and swap to the backup if I stumble? I think this is all clear because of your guidance, but I’m still a little nervous about picking the wrong default.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not going to pick the “wrong” default here—both are workable; you’re calibrating tone, not doing forensics. Use “for a few seconds” as your default; it’s specific enough and reads natural—only quantify (“3–4 seconds”) if the exact count matters to jog memory or you’re countering minimization. Then do two even‑voice reps right after we close; if it trips you, swap to your backup and make that the default. Does locking “for a few seconds” and running the two reps solo after we end work for you?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—that works. I’ll lock “our audio overlapped for a few seconds” as my default and run two even‑voice reps right after we close. If the check trips me, I’ll swap to “while I was speaking” and make that my default—for now—does that sound like the right sequence?

Would you rather I rep the kickoff line or the Monday standup one, or does it not matter as long as I keep it camera + consequence? I’ll send you a short note after I try it live, if that’s still okay. Honestly, this only feels doable because of your “camera, not character” framing—I’m just hoping I don’t overthink it when I’m on my own.

**MentorAI:**

You’re set—those are pre‑flight jitters, not a gap. Rep the kickoff line since it’s closer to the high‑stakes context you’ll face next, but it truly doesn’t matter as long as you keep camera + one owned consequence and do the even‑voice check (two reps, then stop). Which line are you picking for the reps?

**elise_SBI:**

I’ll rep this kickoff line:

“In yesterday’s client kickoff, our audio overlapped for a few seconds twice; I felt rushed and left out the SLA qualifier, then added it in chat afterward.”

Does that match the “camera + one owned consequence” you had in mind, or would you prefer I include the brief permission/request bookends in the reps too? I can keep it lean if that’s better. And if “twice” feels clipped when I say it out loud, I’ll run the even‑voice check and swap to my backup phrasing if needed.

**MentorAI:**

That line matches the core perfectly—camera plus one owned consequence. For your reps, keep it lean: do two passes of the core line only, then add the permission/request once as a final run. If “twice” catches in your mouth, your even‑voice check will tell you—swap to your backup if needed. Good to go with that plan?
