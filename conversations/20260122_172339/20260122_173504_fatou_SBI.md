**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI—anchored moment, camera-testable behavior, and impact in your own words. Success is two solid attempts that hit those marks; I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll get you practicing. Ready for me to model?

**fatou_SBI:**

I guess. Go ahead.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like a bit of hesitation—that’s okay; I’ll keep it crisp. Here’s a quick modeled SBI: “In Tuesday’s standup, while Maya was summarizing the rollback, you started speaking while she was mid-sentence and held the floor for about two minutes; I felt scrambled and missed the exact config change we agreed to, and I had to DM folks after to catch up, which pushed my next task.” I chose one identifiable moment, kept the behavior camera-testable (talked over, duration), and owned the impact with my feeling and a consequence—notice I didn’t use judgment words like “rude” or “unprofessional.” Before I share my quick self-check, how would you decide whether that meets the bar?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don't know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like this feels a bit murky—that’s common right after a demo. Quick self-check I use: 1) Is it one identifiable moment I could put on a calendar? 2) Would a camera capture the behavior exactly as stated (no motives)? 3) Is the impact in my own experience—feeling, body, or direct consequence I had? 4) Red flags: words like “should,” “unprofessional,” “disrespectful” mean judgment leaked in. Try that on my example—what passes, and does anything wobble?

**fatou_SBI:**

It passes. One moment, camera-catchable, your impact. No red flags.

**MentorAI:**

Good—your turn. Think of one real, recent moment with a colleague (e.g., “in Wednesday’s retro”) and draft your feedback in 1–3 sentences: anchor the moment, describe exactly what you saw/heard, and say the impact on you. What’s your full draft?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don't know—some meeting. They were just being difficult. It didn't really affect me.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like this feels murky and a bit annoying—totally normal at this step. Let’s shrink the target to just picking the moment. Which specific meeting from last week can we anchor to—Monday’s standup, your Wednesday 1:1, or Thursday’s planning?

**fatou_SBI:**

I guess… Thursday’s planning.

**MentorAI:**

Nice—picking Thursday’s planning is enough for now; this part trips people up. Can you draft 1–3 sentences starting with “In Thursday’s planning…” that state exactly what I could’ve seen/heard and the effect on you?

**fatou_SBI:**

In Thursday’s planning, when I started to speak, they talked over me and kept going. It didn’t really affect me.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push on your draft—the moment, the behavior description, or the impact line?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like guessing where I’ll push feels tedious—that’s okay. Use the self-check: impact needs to be in your own experience (a feeling, body cue, or a direct consequence you had). “It didn’t really affect me” reads as hedging. Pick one thing you actually experienced in that moment and rewrite just the impact line—what’s your revision?

**fatou_SBI:**

I guess I felt a bit shut down.

**MentorAI:**

That works—and I hear the hedging; naming a feeling can feel exposed, and you did it anyway. Quick why: you chose “shut down”—what made that the right word for your experience in that meeting?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. It just felt like that.

**MentorAI:**

Makes sense—naming a feeling can be awkward, and picking it by feel is totally normal. What was the trickiest part of drafting that?

**fatou_SBI:**

Saying the impact. Just… putting that part into words.

**MentorAI:**

Yep—naming the impact is the hardest part for most people; you’re not missing something obvious. Can you run the self-check we named on your draft and tell me what passes and what you’d tighten?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. You tell me.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you want me to just call it—fair; this part is genuinely hard. I’ll spot you one: your moment and your impact land. The one thing to tighten is the behavior—add a single camera-ready detail (like how long it went on or how many times it happened). What one concrete detail can you add to “talked over me and kept going”?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know—like a minute or so.

**MentorAI:**

Good—use that: “for about a minute” is camera-ready. Stitch it together now in 1–3 sentences, starting with “In Thursday’s planning…,” include the behavior with that detail, and end with your impact (“I felt [shut down]”). What’s your full draft?

**fatou_SBI:**

In Thursday’s planning, when I started to speak, they talked over me and kept going for about a minute. I felt shut down.

**MentorAI:**

This mostly lands. If I were to push on one thing, which part do you think it would be—the moment, the behavior, or the impact?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

That hits the bar—anchored moment, camera-ready behavior with duration, and an owned impact. Let’s raise the stakes: imagine the same pattern happened on yesterday’s client call with Acme, and the person interrupting was your VP; draft your 1–3 sentences. What’s your full attempt?

**fatou_SBI:**

In yesterday’s client call with Acme, when I started to answer, you talked over me and kept going for about a minute. I guess I felt shut down.

**MentorAI:**

What works: the moment is anchored and the behavior is camera-ready with a clear duration. One tweak 🔧: drop the hedge—“I guess” weakens ownership of your impact. Say it plainly (e.g., “I felt shut down”). Revise your full draft with that change and send it back.

**fatou_SBI:**

In yesterday’s client call with Acme, when I started to answer, you talked over me and kept going for about a minute. I felt shut down.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—anchored moment, camera-ready behavior, and an owned impact. Looking back, what will you carry forward about stating impact so you can do it cleanly next time?

**fatou_SBI:**

Keep it about me and say it plainly: “I felt [feeling]” or a concrete consequence—no “I guess,” no judgment words.

**MentorAI:**

Exactly—anchor the moment, describe what a camera would’ve caught, then lock it with a clean, hedge-free impact in your own words (“I felt X” or “I had to Y”). That’s your steady move under pressure—trust it. 👍

**fatou_SBI:**

If you say so.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds a bit skeptical—that’s normal; this move often proves itself in the room more than on paper. Before we close, is there one word in your final draft you’d swap to make it sound like you, or are you good with it as-is?

**fatou_SBI:**

It’s fine as is.

**MentorAI:**

Alright—want to call it here, or is there anything else on SBI you want to tune?

**fatou_SBI:**

We can call it.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good. Before we wrap, what’s the one principle you’ll carry forward to state impact cleanly next time?
