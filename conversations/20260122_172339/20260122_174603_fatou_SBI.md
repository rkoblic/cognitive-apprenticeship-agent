**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means naming a specific moment, describing only what was observable, and owning your impact—and you’ll complete two solid attempts by the end. I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll get you practicing—ready to dive in?

**fatou_SBI:**

If you say so.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like a bit of hesitation—fair and normal. I’ll keep this tight and concrete and show a quick example so you can see the shape: In Tuesday’s standup, while I was sharing my blocker, you started answering the Jira question while I was mid‑sentence—twice. I’m picking that exact moment so it’s anchored; I’m describing what someone could’ve recorded on camera (you began answering while I was talking), not “you were rude”; and I’m owning impact: I lost my place, felt sidelined, and forgot to mention a dependency I needed. What do you notice about how I framed behavior and impact here?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. You tell me.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—sounds murky right now, and that’s fine; this distinction trips a lot of people. Quick check: which of these is an observable behavior?
- “You started talking while I was mid‑sentence—twice.”
- “You were dismissive.”
Which one’s the behavior?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds frustrating—this distinction is genuinely tricky, and you’re not missing something obvious. The observable one is “You started talking while I was mid‑sentence—twice”; “You were dismissive” is a judgment. Quick rule of thumb: if a camera could capture the words/actions exactly, it’s behavior; if it requires mind‑reading, it’s judgment. Want to try turning “You were dismissive” into a one‑sentence, camera‑testable description?

**fatou_SBI:**

You kept interrupting me.

**MentorAI:**

You’re moving toward observable—“interrupting” is closer; we can tighten it with specifics. Ready to try a full draft from your own recent moment? Write a short message to a peer that names the specific meeting, exactly what I would’ve seen/heard, and how it landed for you.

**fatou_SBI:**

In some meeting, you kept interrupting while I was talking. It didn’t really affect me; that’s just how it is.

**MentorAI:**

Thanks for taking a swing—naming a specific moment and owning impact can feel awkward at first. If I had to push on one part—nailing the moment, the what-you-saw/heard, or how it landed—where do you think I’d focus?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

I hear the “whatever you think”—this back-and-forth can feel annoying, and that’s normal when the distinctions are new. Let’s steady it by nailing one piece: the moment. Which specific meeting was it—name it the way it shows up on your calendar (e.g., “Tuesday standup” or “1:1 last Thursday”)?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Tuesday standup.

**MentorAI:**

Good—that’s a real moment we can anchor to. In that Tuesday standup, what exactly did they do or say while you were talking—use words someone could’ve quoted?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. They talked over me, I guess.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like this part’s frustrating—totally normal; “talked over me” is the right direction. To make it camera‑testable, zoom in on the actual words. What were the first words they said when they cut in?

**fatou_SBI:**

They said, “Hold on,” and then kept talking.

**MentorAI:**

Good—that’s concrete progress. Can you pull it together into one short message: name Tuesday’s standup as the moment, quote “Hold on” as the cut‑in while you were mid‑sentence, and say how that landed for you (what you felt or what changed for you right then)?

**fatou_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, while I was talking, you cut in with “Hold on” and kept talking. It didn’t really affect me; that’s just how it is.

**MentorAI:**

You’ve got a real moment and a camera‑testable behavior. In that moment, what did you feel—or what directly changed for you?

**fatou_SBI:**

It didn’t really. I just moved on.

**MentorAI:**

I hear you—naming impact can feel forced, and it doesn’t have to be dramatic. Think micro. In the 10 seconds after they said “Hold on,” what changed for you that a camera might catch—did you pause, restart your sentence, or push through faster?

**fatou_SBI:**

I paused a second, then just kept talking. It wasn’t really anything.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fair—if it felt minor, say minor; micro‑impacts count. In that one‑second pause, which is most true for you: you lost your wording for a moment, felt a flicker of annoyance, or just had to restart your sentence (or something else)?

**fatou_SBI:**

I guess I just restarted my sentence. Not a big deal.

**MentorAI:**

That works—owned impact can be as simple as “I had to restart my sentence.” Can you put it together into one or two sentences: anchor to Tuesday’s standup, quote the cut‑in (“Hold on”) while you were mid‑sentence, and say that immediate impact you experienced?

**fatou_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, while I was mid‑sentence, you cut in with “Hold on.” I paused and had to restart my sentence.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—specific moment, camera‑testable behavior, owned impact. Quick why: you chose “I paused and had to restart my sentence” for the impact—what made you go with that over something like “I felt annoyed”?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. It was just simpler.

**MentorAI:**

Makes sense—going simple is valid when it’s true. Let’s level it up: give feedback to your team lead after Thursday’s client demo, where they cut in mid‑sentence to answer the client and took over. Write a short message that anchors to that moment, describes only what someone could’ve recorded, and owns the immediate impact on you. Your full draft?

**fatou_SBI:**

In Thursday’s client demo, while I was mid‑sentence, you cut in with “Hang on, I can answer that,” and took over. I stopped and didn’t finish my point.

**MentorAI:**

Almost there—anchored moment, quoted words, and the impact is owned. One phrase to tighten 🔧: “took over” reads interpretive; swap it for something a camera would catch, e.g., “you answered the client’s question and kept speaking for the rest of the exchange.” Make that change and share your revised draft?

**fatou_SBI:**

In Thursday’s client demo, while I was mid‑sentence, you cut in with “Hang on, I can answer that,” answered the client’s question, and kept speaking for the rest of the exchange. I stopped and didn’t finish my point.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—anchored moment, camera‑testable behavior, and an owned, immediate impact. It meets the bar 👍. Looking back, what principle will you carry forward the next time you draft SBI feedback?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

Fair enough—sounds like you’re ready to wrap. Keep this one: if a camera couldn’t capture it, it doesn’t belong; then add the single thing that changed for you in the next few seconds.

**fatou_SBI:**

Okay.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good. Nice work—you're set with the camera-test plus immediate-impact cue; call it here?

**fatou_SBI:**

Sure.

**MentorAI:**

All right—closing here. If you want another rep later, send a real moment and we’ll run it through the camera-test plus immediate-impact lens.
