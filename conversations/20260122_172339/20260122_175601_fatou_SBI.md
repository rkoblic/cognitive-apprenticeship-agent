**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a real moment, describe observable behavior, use owned impact language, and can spot when judgment creeps into the behavior. I’ll model it briefly first so you can hear the decisions—ready to dive in?

**fatou_SBI:**

If you say so.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you’re a bit skeptical—totally fair. I’ll keep this tight and useful.

Here’s a quick demo so you can hear the choices I make:
- Pick a real moment: “In Tuesday’s standup when we got to Maria’s update…” (I anchor to a moment they’d recognize, not “lately.”)
- Name only what a camera would catch: “…you started talking over her twice before she finished.” (I avoid judgments like “you were dismissive.” If it’s in their head, it’s not behavior.)
- Own the impact in my body or work: “I felt my shoulders tense and watched the clock; I skipped raising my blocker and lost time that afternoon.” (Owned feeling + concrete consequence I experienced.)
- Put it together in one or two sentences: “In Tuesday’s standup when we got to Maria’s update, you talked over her twice before she finished. I felt tense and watched the clock; I skipped my blocker and lost time later.”
- Quick self-check I use: moment test (is it a recognizable moment?), camera test (could a recorder capture it?), owned impact test (is it my feeling or consequence, not a judgment?).

Ready to try your own situation?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Some meeting. A while ago.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like pinning down one moment feels slippery—totally normal. Let’s make it tiny: think of any meeting in the last two weeks where you felt a jolt (annoyed, rushed, or embarrassed); what was that meeting called?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. The standup.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—locking onto one moment can feel fuzzy. It doesn’t need to be perfect; just a recognizable standup is enough. Which day’s standup are you thinking of?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know… Tuesday, maybe.

**MentorAI:**

Totally okay to be unsure—this part trips people up. Let’s commit to Tuesday’s standup as the moment and move forward. Give me a full try: two sentences that anchor to that standup, name one thing a camera would’ve caught, and say how it landed for you (feeling or consequence). What would you say?

**fatou_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup during updates, you started talking before I finished. It didn’t really affect me—it’s just how it is.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you’re a bit resigned here—totally common with standups. Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push you: the moment, the behavior, or the impact?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you’re over it right now—fair, this can feel nitpicky. Quick self-check: run your two sentences through the moment test, camera test, and owned-impact test—what passes and what doesn’t?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. You tell me.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like this is more annoying than enlightening right now—fair, and you’re not missing something obvious. Let’s make the impact tiny: pick either one small body cue you noticed in that moment or one small consequence to your work—what was it?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Maybe my shoulders tensed. Not a big deal.

**MentorAI:**

That works—“my shoulders tensed” is exactly the kind of owned impact; small counts. Keep Tuesday’s standup as the anchor and “you started talking before I finished” as the camera-visible behavior, then use your shoulders-tensing as the impact. Your turn: put that into two sentences in your own words.

**fatou_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup during updates, you started talking before I finished. My shoulders tensed.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—clear and concise 👍. What were you trying to capture with the phrasing “you started talking before I finished”?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Just that you cut in.

**MentorAI:**

That first draft meets the bar. Let’s raise the stakes: imagine Thursday’s cross‑team planning on Zoom with the director in the room, and your manager jumped in twice while you were answering before you’d finished. Give me your two‑sentence SBI to your manager for that moment.

**fatou_SBI:**

In Thursday’s cross‑team planning on Zoom with the director, you jumped in twice while I was answering. My shoulders tensed.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar. The moment’s specific, the behavior is observable (if you wanted to be extra neutral, “started talking before I finished” is the tightest phrasing), and the impact is owned. What, if anything, felt difficult about delivering that version?

**fatou_SBI:**

I don’t know. Saying it to my manager with the director there.

**MentorAI:**

Makes sense—that’s the hard part: delivering up the chain with an audience. Your SBI is solid; the move is to keep the message and change the moment so it’s lower‑stakes. Takeaway: when stakes rise, don’t soften the facts—shift timing and setting instead. 👍

**fatou_SBI:**

Okay.

**MentorAI:**

Good work—you hit the target. We’ll stop here.

**fatou_SBI:**

Okay.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good. When you’re ready for another run, bring a real moment and we’ll do a quick pass—want to leave it here for today?

**fatou_SBI:**

Yeah. That’s fine.

**MentorAI:**

Alright—nice work today. We can pick it up next time whenever you’ve got a concrete moment to try. Take care.

**fatou_SBI:**

You too.

**MentorAI:**

See you next time.

**fatou_SBI:**

Sure.

**MentorAI:**

Cool. When you’ve got a specific standup moment, drop your two lines (moment, camera‑visible behavior, your felt impact) and we’ll do a quick pass—deal?

**fatou_SBI:**

I guess.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like a tentative yes—no pressure. Next standup, if you notice a jolt, jot the day and one body cue so we have a concrete moment to use; can you do that?

**fatou_SBI:**

I can try.

**MentorAI:**

Appreciate the willingness—what’s one place you’ll jot it so it’s easy to grab later?

**fatou_SBI:**

My phone notes, I guess.

**MentorAI:**

Simple works—phone notes are perfect. To make it easy to find later, pick a quick tag you’ll type at the start (like “SBI–”); what tag will you use?
