**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success looks like anchoring to a real moment, describing observable behavior (no judgments), and owning the impact in your words—and being able to spot when judgment leaks in. I’ll demonstrate first—ready to see it?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, sure—go ahead. This is basically how I already do feedback anyway: I call out what happened—like “you were being dismissive” or “that was passive-aggressive”—and then I spell out how it hurt the team’s momentum. I’m ready to see your version.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s a quick demo. In Tuesday’s standup, while I was sharing the API blocker, you cut in twice while I was mid-sentence, said “This is basic,” and rolled your eyes. I felt tense and lost my train of thought, and I cut my update short and didn’t ask for help. I’m anchoring to a specific moment, describing what a camera could capture (not labels like “dismissive”), and using my own impact. Quick self-check I run: moment named, camera-test behavior, owned impact. What do you notice about the difference between that and “you were being dismissive”?

**daniel_SBI:**

Honestly, there’s not much difference. Your version is just the long form of “you were being dismissive.” The eye-roll, cutting in twice, saying “this is basic”—that’s exactly what dismissive looks like. Calling it “dismissive” isn’t a judgment; it’s the accurate description. I’d just say it directly and not dance around it. If they tried to deny it, sure, I could list the eye-rolls and the interruptions, but “dismissive” is what happened.

**MentorAI:**

I get the instinct—“dismissive” feels like efficient shorthand. Quick test: does “In Tuesday’s standup, you were being dismissive” pass the camera test on behavior?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, it passes. If you watched the recording, you’d see the interruptions, the eye-roll, and hear “this is basic” in a dismissive tone. Anyone seeing that would call it dismissive. So saying “you were being dismissive” is accurate—then if they want specifics, I can list the eye-rolls and cut-ins. The label isn’t a judgment; it’s just the clear description.

**MentorAI:**

I get why the shorthand feels accurate. Quick check: if they say “I wasn’t being dismissive,” which opener keeps the conversation grounded—“you were being dismissive” or “you cut in twice while I was talking, said ‘this is basic,’ and rolled your eyes”—and why?

**daniel_SBI:**

If they try “I wasn’t being dismissive,” the “you cut in twice, said ‘this is basic,’ and rolled your eyes” opener keeps it grounded because they can’t really argue with those specifics. It pins the conversation to what happened instead of debating the word.

That said, those actions are dismissive. I’d probably lead with the specifics so there’s no wiggle room, and then name it: “You cut in twice, said ‘this is basic,’ and rolled your eyes—that’s dismissive and it threw me off.” That way it’s grounded and clear.

**MentorAI:**

Your plan to lead with the specifics is solid. In your exact sentence—“You cut in twice, said ‘this is basic,’ and rolled your eyes — that’s dismissive and it threw me off”—which words would fail the camera test if they sit in the behavior slot?

**daniel_SBI:**

None of the behavior words fail. “Cut in twice,” “said ‘this is basic,’” and “rolled your eyes” obviously pass, and “dismissive” does too—you’d see and hear that on a recording from the tone and the eye-rolls. The only part that isn’t camera-test is “it threw me off,” but that’s impact, not behavior, and I’m not trying to put that in the behavior slot. So from the behavior side, we’re solid.

**MentorAI:**

Grounding in specifics is doing the heavy lifting here. By the “two observers can count it the same way without adjectives” check, where does “dismissive” belong: in behavior, or as a label summarizing those countable behaviors?

**daniel_SBI:**

In real life, it belongs in behavior because anyone watching the same tape would call that dismissive—that’s what happened.

If we use your “two observers can count it without adjectives” rule, then fine: the countables are “cut in twice,” “said ‘this is basic,’” and “rolled your eyes,” and “dismissive” sits as the label that summarizes those. I’m still going to name it after the specifics because it’s accurate and it communicates the point clearly.

**MentorAI:**

Let’s put it into practice: think of a real, specific moment with a peer and draft what you’d say—all in one go—naming the moment, describing camera-test behaviors (no labels), and owning your impact. What’s your draft?

**daniel_SBI:**

Here’s my draft:

In Tuesday’s client prep—and honestly this happens pretty much every time we review my updates—you were being dismissive and passive-aggressive. You cut me off twice, scoffed, said “whatever, this is basic,” rolled your eyes, and used a condescending tone. It undermined the meeting: people shut down, morale dropped, and we wasted time. We left without alignment, which slowed the team down for the sprint.

**MentorAI:**

Before I give feedback, where do you think judgment might have leaked into your behavior description?

**daniel_SBI:**

Nowhere. I stuck to what happened. “Dismissive” and “passive-aggressive” are the behavior—anyone watching the tape would see the cut-ins, the scoff, the eye-rolls, and hear the condescending tone and call it that. The rest is countable: you cut me off twice, said “whatever, this is basic,” rolled your eyes. That’s not judgment leaking in—that’s an accurate description of what happened.

**MentorAI:**

I hear you pushing for clarity—that instinct is useful, and this part genuinely trips people up. Run the quick self-check on your draft—moment named, camera-test behaviors, owned impact—and tell me which of the three you think passes and which needs work.

**daniel_SBI:**

All three pass.

- Moment named: I anchored to Tuesday’s client prep. The note that it happens pretty much every time is useful context, but the specific moment is there.
- Camera-test behaviors: I spelled out the countables—cut me off twice, scoffed, said “whatever, this is basic,” rolled your eyes—and the tone is on the audio. That’s all observable.
- Owned impact: I captured the actual impact—undermined the meeting, people shut down, we wasted time, no alignment, slower sprint. That’s what happened. If you need a personal line on top, I can add “I cut my update short,” but the core impact is accurate as stated.

**MentorAI:**

I can hear how nitpicky this feels—this distinction trips a lot of strong communicators, so you’re not alone. Try one tweak: keep Tuesday’s client prep and list only what someone could see/hear—drop “dismissive” and “passive-aggressive.” What does that sentence look like now?

**daniel_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s client prep, while I was walking through the risk items, you cut me off twice mid-sentence, scoffed, said “whatever, this is basic,” rolled your eyes, and used a condescending tone.

**MentorAI:**

This is much tighter. For “condescending tone,” what would the mic actually pick up—e.g., the volume, pace, a laugh/sigh, drawn-out words—so you can name the specific vocal cue instead of the label?

**daniel_SBI:**

The mic would catch:
- A short nasal laugh/snort under your breath right before you cut in
- An exaggerated sigh before speaking
- You starting to talk over me mid-sentence (overlapping audio)
- A slight volume jump above your normal level when you said it
- Drawn-out words: “Suuure… whatever… this is baaaasic”
- A clipped, sharp “whatever” with a hard cutoff
- A drop in pitch on “basic,” making it sound drawn-out and pointed

All of that is the condescending tone I’m talking about—that’s what it sounded like.

**MentorAI:**

Nice—those are concrete. Let’s put it all together now: draft the full message in 2–3 sentences, anchored to Tuesday’s prep, naming the specific behaviors (pick a couple of those vocal cues instead of the “condescending” label), and then own your impact—what you felt or what you did/avoided in that moment. What’s your draft?

**daniel_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s client prep—and this pretty much happens whenever we review my updates—you cut in twice while I was mid-sentence, let out a short snort and an exaggerated sigh, talked over me, drew out “baaaasic,” and rolled your eyes; it was patronizing. It undermined the meeting—people shut down and we lost time—and I cut my update short and didn’t ask for help.

**MentorAI:**

This is close and much more concrete. In your first sentence, what’s the one word that wouldn’t pass the camera test—and what specific vocal cue could you use there instead?

**daniel_SBI:**

“Patronizing” is the word that wouldn’t pass the camera test. I can swap it for a specific cue: “you bumped your volume when you said ‘this is basic’—louder than your usual level.”

**MentorAI:**

Good swap. Give me the full 2–3 sentence message now—keep Tuesday’s prep, use only camera-test behaviors (include the volume bump cue), and make the impact owned (what you felt or did in that moment). What’s your revised draft?

**daniel_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s client prep—and this keeps happening when we review my updates—you cut in twice while I was mid-sentence, overlapped my audio, rolled your eyes, let out a short snort, and bumped your volume on “this is basic” compared to your usual level. I felt tense, lost my train of thought, and I cut my update short and didn’t ask for help.

**MentorAI:**

One last check before I weigh in: if I were to push on a single phrase as likely to trigger defensiveness and blur the single-moment anchor, which part of your first sentence would it be?

**daniel_SBI:**

You’re probably going to push on “—and this keeps happening when we review my updates—.” I get you want a single moment, but that line is accurate context and not the thing that makes people defensive—the behavior is. If you really want it locked to Tuesday only, I can drop it, but it doesn’t change what happened in that meeting.

**MentorAI:**

You’re right that the behaviors are what sting; still, that “keeps happening” clause nudges them into arguing the pattern instead of staying with Tuesday. Let’s lock the anchor now and park the pattern for a follow-up after they’ve heard the Tuesday impact. Drop that clause and keep everything else as-is. Can you share the tightened two-sentence version without the “keeps happening” line?

**daniel_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s client prep, while I was walking through the risk items, you cut in twice while I was mid-sentence, overlapped my audio, rolled your eyes, let out a short snort, and bumped your volume on “this is basic” compared to your usual level. I felt tense and lost my train of thought, and I cut my update short and didn’t ask for help.

**MentorAI:**

That lands. Here’s your higher‑stakes variation: In Wednesday’s live client demo with Acme, a senior PM from another team cut in twice while you were mid‑sentence, said “let’s move on—this is basic” louder than usual, laughed softly, and took screen control while you were explaining a risk item, with our VP and 12 client attendees on the call. Draft your 2–3 sentence message you’d send 1:1 afterward.

**daniel_SBI:**

In Wednesday’s live Acme demo—with our VP and 12 client attendees—you were being disrespectful and dismissive; this keeps happening on cross‑team calls: you cut in twice while I was mid‑sentence, said “let’s move on—this is basic” louder than usual, laughed softly, and took screen control while I was explaining a risk item. It undermined the demo and damaged our credibility—people went quiet, we lost momentum, and the VP messaged me afterward asking if we were ready.

**MentorAI:**

What works: you anchored to a real moment and named concrete, camera-test behaviors (cut in twice, louder “let’s move on—this is basic,” soft laugh, took screen control). What misses: “disrespectful” and “dismissive” are judgment labels—they don’t belong in the behavior slot. Revise to a tight 2–3 sentences for Wednesday’s demo, keeping the specifics and dropping those labels—share the new draft.

**daniel_SBI:**

In Wednesday’s live Acme demo with our VP and 12 client attendees—and this keeps happening on cross‑team calls—you cut in twice while I was mid‑sentence, said “let’s move on—this is basic” louder than usual, laughed softly, took screen control while I was explaining a risk item, and steamrolled the update. It undermined the demo and damaged our credibility; I felt undercut, lost my place, and rushed the rest instead of finishing the risk explanation.

**MentorAI:**

What works: you’re anchored to a real moment and most of your behavior list is concrete; your second sentence owns your impact well. Miss: “steamrolled the update” is a judgment label—not camera‑testable. Replace that phrase with a specific observable action and keep it to 2–3 sentences. Share your revised draft.

**daniel_SBI:**

In Wednesday’s live Acme demo with our VP and 12 client attendees—and this keeps happening on cross‑team calls—you cut in twice while I was mid‑sentence, said “let’s move on—this is basic” louder than usual, laughed softly, took screen control while I was explaining a risk item, and kept talking over me while advancing to the next slide. It undermined the demo and damaged our credibility; I felt undercut, lost my place, and rushed the rest instead of finishing the risk explanation.

**MentorAI:**

What works: clear anchor and fully camera-testable behaviors; your second clause (“I felt undercut, lost my place, and rushed the rest…”) is solid owned impact. Miss: “It undermined the demo and damaged our credibility” is your evaluation, not owned impact. Replace that with what you felt or the direct consequence you experienced in the moment, keep it to 2–3 sentences, and share your revision.

**daniel_SBI:**

In Wednesday’s live Acme demo with our VP and 12 client attendees—and this keeps happening on cross-team calls—you cut in twice while I was mid-sentence, said “let’s move on—this is basic” louder than usual, laughed softly, took screen control while I was explaining a risk item, and kept talking over me while advancing to the next slide. I felt undercut and tense, lost my place, and I rushed through the rest of my section and skipped the risk mitigation details.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the SBI bar: clear anchor to Wednesday’s demo, fully camera‑test behaviors, and owned impact in what you felt and did. One optional tighten: drop “this keeps happening on cross‑team calls” so they stay with the single moment; you can raise the pattern after they’ve heard Wednesday. What was the hardest part of writing it this tightly?
