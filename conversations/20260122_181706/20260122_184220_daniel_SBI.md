**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework in a professional context. Success looks like anchoring to a real moment, describing observable behavior (no judgments), using owned impact language, and being able to catch when judgment slips into the behavior. I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll practice—ready to jump in?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, I’m ready. I already do this all the time—call out the situation, what they did, and how it tanked the team’s momentum. Go ahead with your demo and I’ll mirror it.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s a quick model you can mirror: In Tuesday’s standup, when you joined about eight minutes after we started and gave your update without mentioning blockers—even when I asked for any—I felt stuck and rushed trying to reshuffle tasks; I extended the meeting by 10 minutes and left unsure about QA timing. I anchored to a real moment, kept the behavior to what a camera could capture (arrival time, specific words/actions), and owned my impact (“I felt… I extended…”), not a judgment. My self-check: is the moment specific, the behavior camera-testable, and the impact in “I” language (not “unprofessional”)? What’s different here from how you’d normally phrase it?

**daniel_SBI:**

Honestly, not much is different. I’d say it more directly. Something like: “In Tuesday’s standup you were being passive-aggressive—showing up late and blowing past blockers even when asked. That’s unprofessional and it derailed the meeting; we lost 10 minutes and the team’s momentum dropped.” That’s how I normally phrase it. I don’t see “passive-aggressive” or “unprofessional” as judgments—they’re accurate descriptions of what happened. The “I felt” piece sounds soft to me. It wasn’t just my feeling; it actually hurt the team. And to be real, this isn’t a one-off—this kind of thing happens a lot in our standups with him.

**MentorAI:**

I get the push for directness—you’re trying to protect the team’s flow. Quick check: if we watched a recording of Tuesday’s standup, what two concrete things would we see or hear that led you to use “passive-aggressive” and “unprofessional”?

**daniel_SBI:**

Two things you’d see and hear on the recording:
- He joined about eight minutes late and went straight into his update without acknowledging it or addressing blockers when prompted.
- When I asked again for blockers, he rolled his eyes and said “sure, whatever” under his breath.

That’s passive-aggressive and unprofessional. Anyone watching that would call it the same—it’s not my interpretation; it’s what happened.

**MentorAI:**

Okay—you’ve got two concrete behaviors to work with. Using Tuesday’s standup as the anchor, can you draft your feedback in 1–2 sentences that sticks to those observable actions (joining late; eye-roll and “sure, whatever”) and uses “I” language for the impact you directly experienced (what you felt or had to do), without labels like “passive-aggressive” or “unprofessional”?

**daniel_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup—which is part of a pattern lately—you joined about eight minutes late, rolled your eyes, and said “sure, whatever” when I asked for blockers; that derailed the meeting and damaged team morale, and I had to extend the meeting by 10 minutes.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where in your draft do you think I’ll push back—specifically, any judgment creeping into the behavior, or impact that isn’t in “I” language?

**daniel_SBI:**

I don’t see any judgment in the behavior part—“joined eight minutes late,” “rolled your eyes,” and said “sure, whatever” are exactly what happened.

If you’re going to push back, it’ll probably be on:
- “Part of a pattern lately” — you’ll say that’s not a single moment, even though it’s accurate context.
- “Derailed the meeting” and “damaged team morale” — you’ll say those aren’t in strict “I” language.

But to me, those aren’t judgments; they’re the real impact. We literally had to extend by 10 minutes, and the room’s energy dropped. I already included “I had to extend the meeting,” which is owned impact. The rest is just stating what actually happened to the team.

**MentorAI:**

You’re right that those behaviors are camera-testable, and I hear you wanting to name the team impact—that instinct makes sense. Can you run the self-check and revise to pass all three: anchor only to Tuesday’s standup (drop the “pattern” clause), keep just the observable actions, and put the impact in “I” language (what you felt or had to do), then share a 1–2 sentence draft?

**daniel_SBI:**

I’ll stick to Tuesday like you asked—even though this isn’t a one-off and those actions were dismissive.

Draft: In Tuesday’s standup, when you joined about eight minutes after we started and, when I asked for blockers, you rolled your eyes and said “sure, whatever,” I had to extend the meeting by 10 minutes to reshuffle tasks, and I left unsure about QA timing. I felt rushed trying to adjust the plan.

Just to be clear, it also lowered the team’s momentum—that’s not a judgment; that’s what happened.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you want the team-level impact named—totally fair; in SBI we keep this draft in your lane first, then expand if needed. What led you to include both “I left unsure about QA timing” and “I felt rushed”—what were you aiming to convey by having both?

**daniel_SBI:**

I included both because they’re not redundant—they capture two separate impacts that actually happened. “I left unsure about QA timing” is the operational hit: I didn’t have the info I needed to sequence work, which is a concrete risk to delivery. “I felt rushed” captures the immediate pressure it put on me to reshuffle on the fly. Together they show it wasn’t just a minor annoyance—it created execution uncertainty and forced me into scramble mode. If I only say one, it undersells what happened.

**MentorAI:**

What, if anything, shifted for you in how you think about “owned impact” after writing that version?

**daniel_SBI:**

Honestly, not much changed in principle—I’ve always aimed to name the impact. The tweak is tactical: putting it in my lane first (“I extended the meeting by 10 minutes,” “I felt rushed”) locks the impact to concrete decisions I made and makes it non-debatable. It still reads as direct, not soft. I can lead with that to anchor the facts, then add the broader effect on the team.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—your first draft meets the bar. Let’s raise the stakes: In Thursday’s cross-functional launch go/no-go with VP Product and the team, your director joined about five minutes late, interrupted your QA update twice, and when you surfaced an API rate-limit blocker said “let’s not get bogged down—ship it and we’ll patch,” then moved on to the next item without assigning owners. Give me your 1–2 sentence SBI you’d say to your director.

**daniel_SBI:**

In Thursday’s cross-functional go/no-go—which is part of a pattern in these leadership reviews—you joined about five minutes late, interrupted my QA update twice, and when I raised the API rate‑limit blocker you said “let’s not get bogged down—ship it and we’ll patch,” then moved on without assigning owners; that was dismissive and reckless. It derailed risk assessment, created confusion about ownership, and put product quality at risk—the room’s confidence dropped and we lost alignment.

**MentorAI:**

Direct feedback: your behaviors are solid, but the impact misses the mark—“dismissive” and “reckless” are judgments, and the rest is team-level without owned “I” language. Keep the same situation and behaviors; rewrite the impact in your lane (what you felt, had to do, or a consequence you directly experienced) in 1–2 sentences, then share the revision.

**daniel_SBI:**

I still think “dismissive” and “reckless” accurately describe what happened, but here’s the revision in my lane:

In Thursday’s go/no-go, when you joined about five minutes late, interrupted my QA update twice, and said “let’s not get bogged down—ship it and we’ll patch,” then moved on without assigning owners, I felt boxed out of raising the risk and left without clarity on who owned the API constraint. I had to spend 45 minutes after the meeting tracking down owners and reworking the QA plan, which pushed my start by a day and put the launch timeline at risk.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar: clear Thursday anchor, camera-testable behaviors, and owned impact that’s concrete and non-debatable. If you want to keep ownership extra tight, you could soften “put the launch timeline at risk” to “I’m concerned it put the timeline at risk,” but your draft already works. What will you carry forward from this into your next real conversation?

**daniel_SBI:**

I’m going to lead with a single, real moment, describe only what a camera would catch, and anchor the impact to what I did or had to do—ideally quantified (“I extended by 10 minutes,” “I spent 45 minutes tracking owners”). Then, once that’s locked, I’ll add the broader consequence so it doesn’t get dismissed (“and that left us unclear on QA timing”). I’ll keep pattern context for later instead of front-loading it. Net: actions first, my owned impact second, team impact third—no labels up top, even if they’re accurate.

**MentorAI:**

That’s a strong plan. Pocket rule: start with one real moment, name only what a camera would catch, anchor impact to what you did/felt (quantify if you can), and add team effects only after that—if a word isn’t camera-testable or in “I” language, swap it for the behavior or your action. Anything else you want to tighten before you take this into a real conversation?

**daniel_SBI:**

It’s pretty dialed. I’ll tighten three things:
- Keep a crisp opener and 1–2 sentence core so it lands cleanly, then add the team impact after.
- Include a concrete ask right after the SBI (“In the next standup, if there’s a blocker, say it out loud and assign owners before we move on”) so it doesn’t float.
- If there’s denial, I’ll loop back to the camera-testable actions and the concrete “I” impact, then note the pattern only after we’ve locked Tuesday/Thursday.

Net: concise delivery, quantified “I” impact, immediate next-step. Labels stay in my back pocket if they keep dodging.

**MentorAI:**

Under pressure, which single step in your plan is the one you’re most likely to skip?

**daniel_SBI:**

The “I” impact line is the first thing to go under pressure. I’ll skip “I extended the meeting/I felt rushed” and jump straight to “that derailed the meeting and hurt the team” with labels like “dismissive.” It’s faster and feels more real in the moment, so that’s the one I’m most likely to drop.

**MentorAI:**

Good catch—that’s the easiest piece to drop under heat. Takeaway: install a speed‑bump—lead with a short “I” line (“I had to extend…” / “I felt rushed…”) before anything else; if your next words aren’t in “I” language, swap them for what you did or decided. Good to go?

**daniel_SBI:**

Good to go. I’ll lead with a quick “I” line as a speed‑bump (“I extended by 10 minutes” / “I felt rushed”), then lock the camera‑testable actions, and only after that add the broader team effect. Labels stay in my back pocket if they keep dodging. This will make the feedback land cleanly every time.

**MentorAI:**

Nice—your plan is crisp. To lock it in, what exact 7–10 word “I” line will you lead with next time?

**daniel_SBI:**

I extended the meeting by ten minutes to reshuffle.

**MentorAI:**

Tight and concrete—perfect speed-bump 👍. What’s the specific cue you’ll use to remember to say it in the moment?

**daniel_SBI:**

When I hear myself start a feedback sentence with “You…,” that’s my cue to stop and lead with my “I” line: “I extended the meeting by ten minutes to reshuffle.”

**MentorAI:**

Nice—clean cue. Before we close, what’s the single principle you’ll carry forward to keep your feedback SBI‑tight under pressure?

**daniel_SBI:**

Lead with a quantifiable “I” line before anything else.

**MentorAI:**

Takeaway: lead with your 7–10 word “I” line as a speed‑bump, then name only what a camera would catch, and add any team effect after—if your next words start with “you,” swap them for “I” or a behavior. You’ve got it—go make it land. 👍

**daniel_SBI:**

Got it. I’ll open with my 7–10 word “I” line, stick to camera-only actions, and add team effects after. If they dodge, I’ll loop back to the facts and then note the pattern. I’ll make it land.

**MentorAI:**

You’re set—your plan’s tight and testable 👍. When’s your next chance to use it?

**daniel_SBI:**

Tomorrow’s 9:30 standup with the web pod—this stuff pops up basically every standup with Marcus, so I’ll use it there. If somehow that’s clean, I’ve got the Thursday 2:00 pm go/no-go pre-read with my director. I’ll lead with “I extended the meeting by ten minutes to reshuffle.”

**MentorAI:**

Nice—perfect moments to use it. Quick pre-commit: draft the exact two sentences you’ll say to Marcus tomorrow—lead with your 7–10 word “I” line, then the camera-only behavior. Want to jot it here so it’s locked before the standup?

**daniel_SBI:**

I extended the meeting by ten minutes to reshuffle.
In today’s standup—as usual—you joined about eight minutes after we started and blew past blockers when I asked for them, rolling your eyes and saying “sure, whatever.”

**MentorAI:**

In that second sentence, what’s the three-word phrase that breaks the single-moment rule—and will you cut it?
