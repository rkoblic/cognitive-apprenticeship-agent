**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success looks like naming a specific moment, describing only observable behavior, owning the impact in your words, and noticing when judgment creeps into behavior. I’ll model once, then we’ll use your situation—ready to start?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, I’m ready. This is basically how I already give feedback—I just tell people what I observed and how it affected the team. Should be pretty straightforward. Go ahead and model it.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s a quick model with think‑aloud. I’ll anchor to a specific moment, keep behavior camera‑testable, and own the impact. “In Tuesday’s standup, while I was updating on the API migration, you jumped in twice while I was mid‑sentence and then switched the screen share to your dashboard. I lost my train of thought and skipped two blockers; we had to follow up in Slack afterward, and I felt rushed.” Why this works: clear moment, observable actions, owned impact (my experience and a concrete consequence), no labels like “dominating” or “always.” My self‑check: could a colleague recognize the moment, could a camera see the behavior, and is the impact mine to own?

What do you want to clarify before we try yours?

**daniel_SBI:**

I don’t need any clarification. Your example’s fine, but I don’t get the “no labels” rule—if someone is being dominating or passive-aggressive, that’s literally the behavior, not a judgment. Calling it out is just accurate. Anyway, I’m good to go—let’s do mine.

**MentorAI:**

Totally get that those labels can feel accurate—let’s test it in action: can you draft your full feedback now, anchoring to a real moment, describing what a camera would’ve captured, and saying how it landed for you or what concrete consequence it had?

**daniel_SBI:**

Situation: This is ongoing with Marcus—it happens basically every weekly standup, including last Thursday’s at 10 a.m.

Behavior: You were being passive-aggressive and dismissive. You kept undercutting my update, interrupted me multiple times, rolled your eyes, and made those little sarcastic side comments. You hijacked the share to push your dashboard and avoided engaging with the points I was making. That’s classic passive-aggressive behavior.

Impact: It derailed the meeting and hurt team morale. People shut down, the collaboration died, we lost about 20 minutes, and decisions got delayed. It created a toxic dynamic that made the team less effective. This needs to stop so we can actually get work done.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back—what in your draft wouldn’t pass the camera test or isn’t owned as your impact?

**daniel_SBI:**

Honestly, most of it passes the camera test. You could literally see the interruptions, the eye rolls, the sarcastic side comments, and him taking over the screen share. Saying “passive-aggressive” is just naming the behavior those actions add up to. On impact, it’s not just about me—we lost 20 minutes, decisions got delayed, and people stopped contributing. Those are facts, not just my feelings. If you’re going to push back on anything, maybe you’ll nitpick “toxic dynamic,” but that’s an accurate description of what happened. I don’t see a real problem here.

**MentorAI:**

You’re right that interruptions, eye rolls, and taking over the share are camera‑testable. To pressure‑test the rest, look only at your behavior lines and name the exact words a camera couldn’t capture—what would you cut or rewrite?

**daniel_SBI:**

If we’re being strict about the camera test, the specific words I’d cut or rewrite from my behavior line are:
- “passive-aggressive”
- “dismissive”
- “undercutting”
- “hijacked”
- “avoided engaging”
- “classic passive-aggressive behavior”
- and probably “sarcastic” (even though the tone was obvious)

Rewritten so it’s camera-testable:
- “In last Thursday’s 10 a.m. standup, while I was mid-sentence in my update, you interrupted me three times.”
- “You rolled your eyes twice during my update.”
- “You said ‘sure, whatever’ and ‘okay, fine’ while I was still speaking.”
- “You switched the screen share from my update to your dashboard without asking.”
- “When I named two blockers, you moved to your dashboard without responding to them.”

I still think “passive-aggressive” and “dismissive” are accurate descriptions of that set of actions, but if you want the literal footage version, that’s it.

**MentorAI:**

For last Thursday only, set aside team morale—what did you personally feel in the moment or have to do afterward, and how would you phrase that in I‑language?

**daniel_SBI:**

For last Thursday: In the moment, I felt rushed and cut off. After the meeting, I had to post my two blockers in Slack, DM you to confirm who owned them, and rewrite my standup note because my update was incomplete. I also had to set up a quick follow‑up to cover what got skipped. That’s not just how I felt—those steps actually happened because of the interruptions.

**MentorAI:**

Nice tightening to camera‑testable behavior and owned impact—now can you pull it into one concise message to Marcus focused on last Thursday: name the moment, list the observable actions (a small cluster is fine), and say how it landed for you/what you had to do afterward?

**daniel_SBI:**

Marcus, this keeps happening, and specifically in last Thursday’s 10 a.m. standup while I was updating on the API migration, you interrupted me three times, rolled your eyes twice, said “sure, whatever,” and switched the screen share to your dashboard mid‑sentence. That was passive‑aggressive and it derailed the meeting—we lost about 20 minutes and people pulled back; I felt rushed and then had to post my two blockers in Slack, DM you to confirm ownership, and set a follow‑up because my update got cut.

**MentorAI:**

Strong anchor and camera-testable actions—that lands. The hitch is in your second sentence: “passive-aggressive” and “derailed the meeting/people pulled back” are labels and non-owned impact. Can you rewrite just that sentence so it owns only your experience and concrete follow-ups (e.g., “I felt…, and then I had to…”), keeping the facts you named?

**daniel_SBI:**

Those weren’t just labels, but if you want the I‑language version, here’s the sentence:
“I felt rushed and cut off, and afterward I had to post my two blockers in Slack, DM you to confirm who owned them, rewrite my standup note, and set a follow‑up because my update was incomplete.”

**MentorAI:**

That I‑language sentence works—owned and concrete. One more tighten: opening with “this keeps happening” widens it from a single moment into a pattern, which invites debate; keep this message anchored to last Thursday only. Can you paste the full message now with that tweak and your revised second sentence?

**daniel_SBI:**

For the record, this is a pattern, but here’s the last‑Thursday‑only version you asked for:

Marcus, in last Thursday’s 10 a.m. standup while I was updating on the API migration, you interrupted me three times, rolled your eyes twice, said “sure, whatever,” and switched the screen share to your dashboard mid‑sentence. I felt rushed and cut off, and afterward I had to post my two blockers in Slack, DM you to confirm who owned them, rewrite my standup note, and set a follow‑up because my update was incomplete.

**MentorAI:**

This meets the bar—anchored to a moment, camera‑testable actions, and owned, concrete impact. Second practice, new variation: you’re giving this feedback upward to your manager, about a single moment in a monthly product review with the VP in the room—higher stakes, same kinds of behaviors. Draft the full message for that one meeting only; keep behavior camera‑testable and the impact yours to own. Your turn.

**daniel_SBI:**

This keeps happening, and specifically in last month’s product review on Tuesday at 2 p.m. with the VP in the room: while I was walking through the churn analysis, you jumped in three times mid‑sentence, rolled your eyes, said “let’s not get into that” and “we’re off track,” and then took control of the deck to your roadmap slide. You were being dismissive and undermining. It undercut our credibility with the VP, derailed the flow of the review, people stopped asking questions, and we spent an extra 25 minutes afterward clarifying decisions that should have been settled in the meeting. It created a bad look for the team.

**MentorAI:**

What’s working: you anchored to a single meeting and most of the actions are camera‑testable. The miss is impact—you’re inferring the VP’s perception and team dynamics (“credibility,” “derailed,” “bad look”) rather than owning what you felt and what you personally had to do after. Keep the moment and behaviors; rewrite the impact in I‑language with concrete follow‑ups you did because of that meeting. Give me the full message with just that change.

**daniel_SBI:**

I don’t think I was just inferring—when the VP stops asking questions and the room goes quiet, that does undercut credibility. But if you want the I‑language version, here’s the full message with just the impact rewritten:

This keeps happening, and specifically in last month’s product review on Tuesday at 2 p.m. with the VP in the room: while I was walking through the churn analysis, you jumped in three times mid‑sentence, rolled your eyes, said “let’s not get into that” and “we’re off track,” and then took control of the deck to your roadmap slide. I felt rushed and undercut in the moment, and afterward I had to re‑run the parts of the analysis I didn’t finish, send a follow‑up summary email, DM you and the VP’s chief of staff to confirm two decisions, and set a 15‑minute follow‑up to close the open items from my section.

**MentorAI:**

Most of this hits the mark: clear moment, camera‑testable behaviors, and owned, concrete impact. One fix: “This keeps happening” widens it into a pattern—drop that so this stays about that single meeting. Can you paste the revised message with that cut?

**daniel_SBI:**

In last month’s product review on Tuesday at 2 p.m. with the VP in the room, while I was walking through the churn analysis, you jumped in three times mid‑sentence, rolled your eyes, said “let’s not get into that” and “we’re off track,” and then took control of the deck to your roadmap slide. I felt rushed and undercut in the moment, and afterward I had to re‑run the parts of the analysis I didn’t finish, send a follow‑up summary email, DM you and the VP’s chief of staff to confirm two decisions, and set a 15‑minute follow‑up to close the open items from my section.

**MentorAI:**

This meets the bar—anchored moment, camera‑testable behaviors, and owned, concrete impact. When you’re tempted to use labels in the future, what principle will you carry forward to keep it SBI‑clean?

**daniel_SBI:**

My principle: translate the label into receipts. If I hear myself thinking “passive‑aggressive,” “dismissive,” or “derailed,” I convert it to:
- one anchored moment,
- the exact actions a camera would catch (quotes, counts, who took the screen, interruptions),
- and my owned impact (“I felt X, and I had to do Y and Z after”).

If I can’t point to two concrete actions and a specific follow‑up I did, it’s a label—I rewrite it as observable actions plus my I‑language impact. I’m still seeing the pattern, but I’ll lead with the footage and what it cost me.

**MentorAI:**

That’s it 👍 Your “labels → receipts” rule is the portable check: if a camera couldn’t capture it or you didn’t personally feel/do it, it doesn’t go in. Lead with one anchored moment, then your owned impact—that keeps the message concrete even when the stakes are high.

**daniel_SBI:**

Yep, that’s exactly how I’ll run it—one anchored moment, the concrete actions the camera would catch, then my “I felt…and I had to…” follow‑ups. The behavior is still what it is, but I’ll let the receipts say it. I’ll use this in my next standup with Marcus and in my manager 1:1 before the next VP review so we cut the debate and move straight to fixes.

**MentorAI:**

In the live moment, what exact opener will you use in each conversation to anchor the moment and cue yourself into receipts—word for word?

**daniel_SBI:**

- Marcus opener: “Marcus, this keeps happening—specifically in last Thursday’s 10 a.m. standup during my API migration update; here’s what a camera would’ve caught.”

- Manager opener: “In last month’s Tuesday 2 p.m. product review with the VP, this has been a pattern, and I’m going to stick to what the footage would show.”

**MentorAI:**

Love the “footage” cue—keep that. Drop “this keeps happening”/“pattern”; it invites debate and pulls you off the single moment. Try: “Marcus, in last Thursday’s 10 a.m. standup during my API migration update—here’s what a camera would’ve caught.” And: “In last month’s Tuesday 2 p.m. product review with the VP, while I was walking through the churn analysis—here’s what the footage would show.” Say your final word‑for‑word openers with that tweak.

**daniel_SBI:**

- “Marcus, in last Thursday’s 10 a.m. standup during my API migration update—here’s what a camera would’ve caught.”
- “In last month’s Tuesday 2 p.m. product review with the VP, while I was walking through the churn analysis—here’s what the footage would show.”

**MentorAI:**

What, if anything, was hardest about staying out of labels and sticking to the “footage + my follow‑ups” receipts?

**daniel_SBI:**

The hardest parts were:
- Not naming the obvious label. Saying “passive‑aggressive” or “dismissive” is accurate and efficient; translating it into a list of actions felt like sanitizing what was actually happening.
- Staying out of pattern language. Keeping it to one moment feels incomplete when it’s clearly recurring—it leaves the door open for “well that was just that day.”
- Owning only my impact instead of the objective fallout. “It derailed the meeting” and “hurt credibility” weren’t guesses—they happened. Reframing to “I felt rushed and then I had to do X, Y, Z” felt like under‑stating the real effect.
- Counting specifics in real time. Saying “interrupted me three times” or quoting exact phrases takes extra mental overhead when I could just say “you kept interrupting.”
- Not calling intent. When someone’s undermining, it’s obvious; avoiding that word felt like ignoring the elephant in the room.

I can do the receipts because they’re harder to argue with, but I still think the labels name the thing more directly. The trick for me is biting my tongue on the label and letting the footage imply it.

**MentorAI:**

You’re naming the real tension—labels feel faster and more “true,” and SBI can feel like it softens the edge. Your takeaway to carry forward: lead with footage + I‑impact, then—only after that—surface pattern or intent as a separate move framed as a testable offer, not a label (e.g., “I’m seeing the same combo in standups; I can share more examples,” or “I’m reading this as undermining—if that’s not your intent, help me understand”). That lets the receipts do the heavy lift while still naming the larger thing you care about. Will that two‑step move work for you in those next conversations?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, that works for me. I’ll lead with receipts and my I‑impact, then I’ll surface the bigger point as a testable offer. Word-for-word after the receipts:

- To Marcus: “I’m seeing the same combo in recent standups; I can share more examples if that’s useful.”
- To my manager: “I’m reading this as undermining in that review—if that’s not your intent, help me understand what you were aiming to do.”

If they deny, I’ll pull more footage. I’m not going to ignore the pattern, but I’ll let the receipts land first and then make the pattern/intent an offer instead of a label.

**MentorAI:**

Your playbook is solid: lead with footage plus your I‑impact, then surface pattern or intent as a testable offer—your “labels → receipts” rule and the “footage” cue will keep you out of debate and in fixes. If a label pops up, translate it into two observable actions and one concrete follow‑up you did, then proceed. Good to close here?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, good to close. I’ve got the playbook: lead with the footage and my I‑impact, then surface pattern or intent as a testable offer. If a label pops up, I’ll translate it into two actions and one concrete follow‑up I did. I’ll run this in my next standup and my 1:1 before the VP review.

**MentorAI:**

You’re set—the “footage + my I‑impact, then testable offer” move will keep you in facts and out of debate. Anything else you want before we wrap?

**daniel_SBI:**

I’m good. This lines up with how I already operate—now I’ll just lead with the footage and my I‑impact, then make the pattern/intent a testable offer. I’ve got my openers and I’ll use them in the next standup and my 1:1. All set to wrap.

**MentorAI:**

One last suggestion: right after each convo, jot the exact quotes/actions and the one or two follow‑ups you did—keeps your receipts sharp and makes the pattern easy to surface later. You’ve got it—go run it, and bring back footage if you want a quick tune‑up.
