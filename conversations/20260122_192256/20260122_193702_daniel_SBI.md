**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework in a professional context. Success is you completing two solid attempts that anchor a real moment, describe observable behavior, use owned impact—and you can spot when judgment leaks in. I’ll demonstrate first so you can see the thinking; ready to begin?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, ready. I already do this naturally—call out what actually happened and how it tanked morale—so I’m curious to see your version. Go ahead.

**MentorAI:**

I’ll use a standup example and narrate my choices as I go. I anchor it: “In Tuesday’s standup while Priya was sharing the metrics…” Then I keep the behavior camera-testable: “you started talking while she was mid-sentence twice and steered us to the signup bug before she wrapped.” And I own the impact on me and a direct consequence: “I felt my stomach knot and lost my place in the agenda; we spent five minutes on the bug so I cut the sprint risks short.” I’m avoiding labels like “undermining” and sticking to counts and what a camera would catch; I’m also not saying “it was unprofessional”—I’m naming my actual reaction and what it made me do. What stands out to you in that version?

**daniel_SBI:**

The counts are fine, but honestly, I’d just say it straight: you cut Priya off and undermined her—that’s what happened. This kind of thing happens constantly in standups, and when it does, it derails the meeting. I don’t think you need the “I felt my stomach knot” part; the impact is obvious—people shut down and we lose momentum. Also, tone matters: if someone’s being passive-aggressive or dismissive, that’s observable, not just a label. Avoiding “unprofessional” feels like sugarcoating when the behavior is clearly unprofessional.

**MentorAI:**

I hear the push for plain talk—SBI isn’t about softening; it’s about precision. Quick check: take “you were dismissive”—if you run the camera test, what would the lens capture (specific words, timing, gestures) that lets you say that without adding interpretation?

**daniel_SBI:**

A camera would catch it just fine: eye-roll as soon as I start, a long exhale, then cutting me off mid-sentence twice within the first minute. You’d hear “yeah, okay” and “sure, whatever” in a flat, sarcastic tone right after I finish a point. There’s a smirk, a little shrug with palms up, looking away to the laptop and typing while I’m talking, then immediately pivoting to a different topic before acknowledging what I said. That’s dismissive behavior. It’s not interpretation—those are textbook signs, and anyone watching the footage would see it the same way.

**MentorAI:**

Given the cues you just listed are camera-testable, pick one specific recent moment (e.g., yesterday’s standup) and draft your feedback in 2–4 sentences that anchor that moment, describe exactly what the camera would catch, and name your own impact (your feeling or a direct consequence on you). What’s your draft?

**daniel_SBI:**

In yesterday’s standup—like you usually do in these—you were dismissive while Priya was sharing metrics. You rolled your eyes as I started, cut me off twice within a minute, said “sure, whatever” in a flat tone, and pivoted to the signup bug before she finished—that’s passive-aggressive. It derailed the meeting—people stopped contributing and morale dropped—and we burned five minutes on the bug, so I had to cut the sprint risks short.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, predict where I’ll push back: which phrase in your draft is most likely leaking judgment or missing owned impact?

**daniel_SBI:**

You’ll probably zero in on “like you usually do,” “dismissive,” and “that’s passive-aggressive,” and say those are judgments. And you’ll likely flag “it derailed the meeting—people stopped contributing and morale dropped” as missing owned impact. To be clear, that’s not judgment—that’s what happened. The pattern is real, the behavior was dismissive/passive-aggressive by any reasonable standard, and the meeting did stall because of it. If you’re asking what you’ll push back on, it’ll be those phrases—but they’re accurate.

**MentorAI:**

I hear the push to name the real pattern and not sugarcoat—and you’re right the room stalled; you’re not imagining it. Run this self-check on your draft: camera-only behavior, no labels or pattern claims unless tied to a single moment, and impact in “I” language or a direct consequence on you. Using that, what in your draft passes, and what would you change?

**daniel_SBI:**

What passes: the anchor to “yesterday’s standup,” the camera-catchable behaviors (eye-roll, cutting me off twice within a minute, saying “sure, whatever,” and pivoting to the signup bug before Priya finished), and the direct consequence on me (“we spent five minutes on the bug, so I cut the sprint risks short”).

What I’d change: drop “like you usually do,” drop the labels “dismissive” and “that’s passive-aggressive,” and replace “people stopped contributing and morale dropped” with owned impact on me. The label is still accurate, but per your camera rule I’ll leave it out.

Tightened draft:
- In yesterday’s standup while Priya was sharing metrics, you rolled your eyes as I started, cut me off twice within a minute, said “sure, whatever” right after I finished a point, and shifted us to the signup bug before she wrapped. I lost my place in the agenda, and we spent five minutes on the bug, so I cut the sprint risks short.

**MentorAI:**

You swapped “morale dropped” for “I lost my place… cut risks short”—why choose those impacts to name, and what were you aiming to accomplish by making it about your consequence rather than the room’s?

**daniel_SBI:**

I picked those because they’re indisputable and inside my lane. “I lost my place” and “I cut the sprint risks short” are concrete, measurable consequences I owned—there’s nothing to debate there. What I’m aiming for is traction: if I lead with my consequence, they can’t deflect into “morale didn’t drop” or “people seemed fine,” which always derails these conversations.

That doesn’t mean the room impact wasn’t real—it objectively was. I’m just sequencing it. Start with what’s undeniable (my action and the five minutes we burned), then, if needed, layer in camera-catchable room effects like “after your interjections, three people who had their hands up stopped volunteering.” This way I keep the focus and still make the broader point without giving them an easy out.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—anchored moment, camera-only behavior, and owned impact. 👍 What felt most different about writing it this way compared to how you usually give feedback?

**daniel_SBI:**

It felt more clinical and constrained. Normally I just say what it was—“you were dismissive and it killed the meeting”—because that’s accurate and faster. Here I had to track exact counts and timing and stick to one moment instead of calling out the pattern that happens all the time. Dropping the labels felt like not naming the real issue, even though I still think they’re accurate. The big difference was leading with my consequence (“I lost my place… cut risks short”), which makes it harder for them to dodge. So it’s more work, but it closes the denial gap. The room impact still matters—I’m just sequencing it after the undeniable stuff.

**MentorAI:**

You’re ready for a higher‑stakes variation. In last Thursday’s cross‑team demo with the VP and two clients on the call, your manager cut off the PM mid‑sentence, waved a hand and said “let’s move on” while you were answering, then pivoted the agenda to a different topic. Draft the feedback you’d deliver in 2–4 sentences.

**daniel_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s cross‑team demo with the VP and two clients, you were disrespectful and undermining—you cut off the PM mid‑sentence, waved your hand, said “let’s move on” while I was answering, and pivoted the agenda to a different topic. This keeps happening in exec settings and it was unprofessional; it derailed the flow and damaged our credibility with the clients—the room went quiet and they stopped asking questions. It wasted five minutes and forced me to skip the integration risks section.

**MentorAI:**

Anchor and behaviors land; the eye-roll, hand wave, “let’s move on,” and agenda pivot are camera‑clean, and “I skipped the integration risks” plus the five minutes is a solid owned consequence. What misses: judgment leaks and pattern claims—“disrespectful/undermining,” “keeps happening,” “unprofessional,” and “damaged our credibility” aren’t owned impact. Keep the room effects only if you state what a camera would show (“after that, no one asked a question for the rest of the demo”); center your impact. Revise to 2–4 sentences with those fixes and drop it in.

**daniel_SBI:**

In last Thursday’s cross-team demo with the VP and two clients, you cut off the PM mid-sentence, waved your hand, said “let’s move on” while I was answering, and pivoted the agenda to a different topic. I felt my stomach knot and lost my place; we spent about five minutes on the new topic, and I skipped the integration risks section. After that, no one asked a question for the rest of the demo.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar—anchored moment, camera‑clean behaviors, and owned impact; the room effect line works because it’s observable, not a credibility judgment. Nicely sequenced, too—the “I lost my place… skipped risks” keeps focus where you have agency. 👍 What principle or phrasing from this version will you carry forward when the stakes are high and the recipient has more power than you?

**daniel_SBI:**

- Lead with what they can’t argue: my consequence. The phrasing I’ll carry forward is “I lost my place and skipped X” or “we spent five minutes on Y, so I cut Z,” because it closes the denial gap in exec settings.
- Use camera verbs and quotes: “you cut off,” “you waved,” “you said ‘let’s move on,’” “you pivoted.” Counts and exact words beat labels.
- Sequence matters: anchor the moment → camera behavior → my consequence → optional room effect only if it’s observable (“after that, no one asked a question”).

I still think “undermining” names the real issue, but in high‑power situations I’ll park the label and let the facts and my consequence do the work first.

**MentorAI:**

Carry this forward: when power dynamics are real, let counts and quotes carry the message and lead with the consequence you owned; that sequence closes the denial gap without softening the point. That’s the muscle to keep building.

**daniel_SBI:**

Got it. I’ll lead with my consequence and let counts and quotes do the heavy lifting—anchor, camera, my consequence, then any observable room effect. That closes the denial gap in exec rooms without watering it down. I’m still going to name the bigger issue if they keep dodging, but I’ll start with the indisputable facts and what it made me do so there’s nowhere to hide.

**MentorAI:**

You’ve got your sequence. If you do name the pattern later, stack specific anchored moments instead of “you always,” and keep your owned consequence up front—let counts and quotes do the heavy lifting. Good to go?

**daniel_SBI:**

Good to go. I’ll lead with counts and quotes and put my consequence up front, then stack specific moments if I need to show a pattern—no “you always,” just Tuesday, Thursday, etc. I’m not going to tiptoe if it keeps happening, but I get that anchoring and owning my consequence first makes it airtight and harder to dodge. This comes up a lot with the same people, so this sequence will land.

**MentorAI:**

That’s solid. Facts first, your consequence next, then any observable room effect—you’re set. 👍

**daniel_SBI:**

Yep—locked in. I’ll run it in the next leadership sync: anchor the moment, use counts and quotes, lead with the consequence I owned, then add any observable room effect. If there’s pushback, I’ll stack specific dates instead of “you always.” And if it keeps repeating, I’ll name the pattern later—but I’ll let the footage and my consequence carry it first.

**MentorAI:**

Takeaway: in tough rooms, lead with the consequence you owned and let counts and quotes do the talking; if you need to show a pattern, stack anchored moments instead of labels. Anything else you want to tune before you run it?

**daniel_SBI:**

I’m set. I’ll lock the opener to a two-sentence spine: anchor + counts/quotes, then my consequence; add an observable room effect only if it’s camera-clean. I’ll capture counts and exact quotes live in my notes so I can drop them verbatim. If there’s denial, I’ll stack two more anchored moments with the same structure; if it keeps repeating, I’ll name the pattern via my consequence (“I’ve had to skip risk sections in three of the last four demos”) before anything else. And I’m not softening the message—just making it indisputable.

**MentorAI:**

Lock in that two‑sentence spine with live counts/quotes, and if you need to show a pattern, stack anchored moments tied to the consequence you owned—candid, airtight, no easy outs. 👍

**daniel_SBI:**

Locked. I’ll run the two‑sentence spine with live counts and quotes, lead with the consequence I owned, and only add an observable room effect if it’s camera‑clean. If there’s pushback, I’ll stack anchored moments tied to my consequence—no “you always,” just dates and quotes. If it keeps repeating after that, I’ll name the pattern on the back of those moments. Ready to use it in the next exec room.

**MentorAI:**

You’re set—run the two‑sentence spine with counts and quotes, lead with your consequence, and stack dated moments only if needed. Will you check back after the sync with how it landed and one line you’d keep verbatim?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yes—I’ll check back after the sync. The line I’m keeping verbatim: “We spent five minutes on the detour, so I cut the risks section.” Execs can’t argue with that, and it keeps the focus where I have agency.

**MentorAI:**

That line does the work; for delivery, will you say it clean and then leave a full beat of silence so it lands?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yes. I’ll say it clean, stop talking, and hold a full beat of silence with eye contact—hands still, no fidgeting. I use that pause on purpose; in exec rooms it makes the point land and leaves no easy out.

**MentorAI:**

Clean delivery and a full beat—good. What signal in the room will tell you it landed right after your pause?

**daniel_SBI:**

The tell is camera-clean: the VP stops typing, looks up, and nods once—then you get a direct, on-topic response like “Okay, finish the risks.” Second-best signal: there’s two full seconds of silence after my pause and no cross-talk, then someone asks a consequence question—“What did we miss by skipping risks?” You’ll also see the manager’s hand come down, they turn back to the deck, and the room refocuses on the risks slide. That’s how you know it landed.

**MentorAI:**

Takeaway: your spine is airtight—counts and quotes, your consequence cleanly stated, then a full beat; read the VP’s look‑up or two‑count silence as your green light to proceed. You’ve got it. 👍

**daniel_SBI:**

Locked. I’ll run counts and quotes, state my consequence cleanly, then hold a full beat and take the VP’s look‑up or a two‑count silence as the green light to proceed. If there’s pushback, I’ll stack dated moments; otherwise I move straight to finish the risks. I’ll circle back after the sync with how it landed and the one line to keep verbatim.

**MentorAI:**

When you check back, will you bring the exact two-sentence spine you used so we can tune a word or two if needed?
