**MentorAI:**

We’re focusing on delivering peer feedback using SBI. Success means you anchor to a real moment, describe observable behavior, and use owned-impact language—and you’ll learn to catch judgment sneaking into behavior. I’ll demonstrate how I think through it first; ready to begin?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, I’m ready. Just so you know, I already give pretty direct feedback—I stick to what I see. If someone’s being passive-aggressive or checked out, I call it. That’s not judgment; that’s what happened. But sure, go ahead and demonstrate your version and I’ll match it.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s a quick think-aloud demo. In Tuesday’s standup while I was walking through the rollout, you said “Can we not derail this again?” in a low voice and then typed on your laptop for the next few minutes. I lost my place and felt on the spot, and I cut the section short; I followed up in Slack afterward to cover what I skipped. Notice the choices: I anchored to a specific meeting, swapped labels for exact quotes/actions (camera test), and used owned impact (my feeling and a concrete consequence); my self-check is “meeting + camera + my body/consequence.” Your turn when you’re ready.

**daniel_SBI:**

Sure—here’s mine.

Situation: This is ongoing with Marcus. It happens basically every standup, including Tuesday’s 9:30 standup in the huddle area.

Behavior: He was being passive-aggressive—undermining what I was saying. Eye-rolling, little snide comments under his breath, and a dismissive tone. That’s classic passive-aggressive behavior.

Impact: It derailed the meeting and damaged team morale. People stopped contributing and the energy dropped. We lost momentum and had to rehash parts later, which slowed the rollout.

Self-check: I’m anchored to the meeting, and the camera test is met—I’m describing what happened. “Passive-aggressive,” the eye rolls, the comments—those are concrete. This isn’t judgment; it’s accurate.

**MentorAI:**

You’ve anchored to a real standup—good. If I were to push back anywhere, where do you think it’d be—your behavior phrasing or your impact language—and why?

**daniel_SBI:**

Honestly, neither needs pushback. The behavior phrasing is accurate—“passive-aggressive” is what he was doing, and I backed it with exactly what you could see: eye-rolling, snide under-the-breath comments, dismissive tone. And the impact language is just reality: the meeting derailed, people stopped contributing, morale dropped, we had to rehash later. Those are outcomes, not opinions.

If you were going to push anywhere, I guess you’d say “passive-aggressive” is a label and try to force me to only use quotes. Or you’d want me to say “I felt” on the impact. But that would water down what actually happened. The room went quiet, participation dipped, and we lost time—that’s factual.

**MentorAI:**

I hear your push for straight talk—that’s useful here. The spots that leak judgment are the labels (“passive-aggressive,” “snide,” “dismissive”), which a camera can’t capture. For Tuesday’s 9:30 standup only, can you rewrite the behavior as one sentence with a quote and an action (e.g., the eye roll), no labels?

**daniel_SBI:**

It was still passive-aggressive, but if you want the camera version: In Tuesday’s 9:30 standup, he said “sure, whatever” right after I finished speaking and rolled his eyes while turning back to his laptop.

**MentorAI:**

I hear you—naming it as passive-aggressive makes sense from your seat, and thanks for translating it into camera-clean behavior. For that same Tuesday moment, can you rewrite the impact as one sentence in owned language—start with “I…” and name either what you felt or what you had to change/do as a result?

**daniel_SBI:**

I had to cut my update short and push the skipped details to Slack afterward to keep the meeting moving.

**MentorAI:**

Nice—owned and specific. Can you stitch the whole thing together now as one concise draft for Tuesday’s 9:30 standup, using that quote-plus-action for the behavior and your “I had to…” impact?

**daniel_SBI:**

It’s still passive-aggressive, but here’s the camera-clean draft: In Tuesday’s 9:30 standup, you said “sure, whatever” right after I finished speaking and rolled your eyes while turning back to your laptop; I had to cut my update short and push the skipped details to Slack afterward to keep the meeting moving.

**MentorAI:**

This lands: specific moment, camera‑clean behavior, owned consequence—good work. The one leak is that opener “It’s still passive‑aggressive,” which is a judgment label; this is where it tends to creep in for folks. Drop that line and you’ve met the bar—can you restate the draft without the label up front?

**daniel_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s 9:30 standup, you said “sure, whatever” right after I finished speaking and rolled your eyes while turning back to your laptop; I had to cut my update short and push the skipped details to Slack afterward to keep the meeting moving.

That’s exactly what happened—and anyone in the room would agree it derailed things—even if I’m leaving the label out.

**MentorAI:**

For a variation: In Wednesday’s 11:00 client kickoff on Zoom, your peer from Sales, Dana, said “let’s not pretend this is on track” right after your update began and then typed on Slack for a few minutes while the client watched. Draft your feedback to Dana as one concise SBI message for that exact moment.

**daniel_SBI:**

This keeps happening on Sales calls, and in Wednesday’s 11:00 client kickoff on Zoom, when you said “let’s not pretend this is on track” right as my update began and then typed on Slack for a few minutes with the client watching, it was undermining and unprofessional and it derailed the kickoff—the client went quiet, we lost credibility, and we had to re-explain basics afterward.

**MentorAI:**

Your anchor and the quote+action land—those pass the camera test. The leaks: opening with “This keeps happening…” widens beyond the single moment; “undermining/unprofessional” are judgment labels; and in impact, “derailed” and “we lost credibility” are judgments—switch to owned impact (what you felt or what you had to do), keeping concrete bits like “the client went quiet” and what you changed. Give it one clean sentence for that exact moment using your quote+action and owned impact—can you revise now?

**daniel_SBI:**

In Wednesday’s 11:00 Zoom client kickoff, when you said “let’s not pretend this is on track” as my update began and then typed on Slack for a few minutes with the client watching, I paused to address it, the client went quiet, and I cut my update and re-explained basics afterward.

That wasn’t just my reaction; it derailed the kickoff and the client lost confidence.

**MentorAI:**

I get wanting to flag the broader effect—that impulse makes sense. The snag is the second sentence: “derailed” and “lost confidence” are judgment, not owned impact. Drop that line and keep it to one clean sentence with the quote+action and what you did. Can you share that single‑sentence version now?

**daniel_SBI:**

In Wednesday’s 11:00 Zoom client kickoff, when you said “let’s not pretend this is on track” as my update began and then typed on Slack for a few minutes with the client watching, I paused to address it, the client went quiet, and I cut my update and re-explained basics afterward.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar—anchored moment, camera‑clean behavior, and owned impact (“I paused… I cut… I re‑explained”). If you want to tighten to pure owned impact, you could drop “the client went quiet”; as written, it still lands. What, if anything, shifted for you about separating labels from behavior through these two drafts?

**daniel_SBI:**

What shifted is the tactic, not the read. I still know what I saw—those moments were passive-aggressive and they did hit the room. But spelling it as quotes and actions makes it non‑debatable, and starting the impact with what I did (“I cut my update… I re‑explained…”) keeps the conversation on facts instead of arguing my wording. So I’m not backing off the label being accurate—I’m just leading with the camera‑clean pieces because they’re harder to dodge and get me to the point faster.

**MentorAI:**

That’s the move: keep your read, but lead with one moment, what a camera would capture, and what you did or felt—interpretations can come later if they’re needed. A simple self-check you can reuse is “moment + camera + I did/felt.” You’ve got it 👍

**daniel_SBI:**

Yeah, that works. “Moment + camera + I did/felt” is simple and I can run that in standups and client calls. It’s not softening—it’s tightening so the facts are undeniable, and if I need to layer the interpretation later, I will. I’ve got the move.

**MentorAI:**

Keep your read, but lead with one moment + what a camera would capture + what you did/felt. When you feel the urge to label (“passive‑aggressive,” “unprofessional”), take it as a cue to swap in a quote and an action first; layer interpretation later only if needed. That keeps your feedback non‑debatable and moves the conversation forward 👍

**daniel_SBI:**

Got it. I’ll use the cue—when I want to say “passive‑aggressive” or “unprofessional,” I’ll lead with the exact quote and the visible action, then say what I did or had to change. If they keep dodging, I’ll name the pattern after. That keeps it non‑debatable and moves things forward without me watering anything down.

**MentorAI:**

Locked in. Your cue plus “moment + camera + I did/felt” keeps it sharp without watering anything down. Anything else you want to sanity‑check before we wrap?

**daniel_SBI:**

I’m good. I’ll run this in Friday’s 9:30 standup with Marcus—lead with the exact quote and eye‑roll, then what I did (“I cut the update and had to follow up”). If he dodges, I’ll name the pattern after. I’m set.

**MentorAI:**

You’re set. Carry this in: when the label pops up, swap in the exact quote + visible action, then own what you did/felt; layer interpretation only if needed after. Want to check back after Friday’s standup to see how it landed?

**daniel_SBI:**

Sure—let’s do a quick 10-minute debrief right after Friday’s 9:30 standup. I’ll run the cue (quote + visible action + what I did), and if he dodges, I’ll name the pattern. We can check how it landed then.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—I’ll be here. Right after the standup, can you jot the exact quote/action you reference and the one thing you did or changed so we’ve got it fresh for the debrief?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yep. Right after the standup I’ll jot:
- Quote + action: “sure, whatever” right after I finish, plus the eye roll while turning back to his laptop.
- One change I made: I cut my update and moved the details to Slack.

That’ll be fresh for the debrief.

**MentorAI:**

Solid. To keep delivery clean under pressure, pick your neutral opener now—first 3–5 words you’ll start with so you launch straight into moment + camera + I did/felt. What are those words?

**daniel_SBI:**

In Friday’s 9:30 standup,

**MentorAI:**

That opener works. Can you say the full single sentence you’ll deliver—moment + exact quote/action + what you did—to lock it in now?

**daniel_SBI:**

In Friday’s 9:30 standup, you said “sure, whatever” right after I finished and rolled your eyes while turning back to your laptop; I cut my update and moved the details to Slack to keep the meeting moving.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—anchored, camera‑clean, owned impact. For delivery, do you want to split the semicolon into two sentences to make it easier under pressure, or are you good as‑is?

**daniel_SBI:**

As‑is. I like the single breath—it keeps it tight and direct. If I need to split under pressure, I’ll just drop a beat and say the second part as a follow‑up sentence, but I’m fine delivering it as one line.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good. One last tip: deliver it calm and matter‑of‑fact, then stop—let the pause do the work instead of rushing to explain. You set to run it that way on Friday?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yep—I’m set. I’ll deliver it calm and matter‑of‑fact in one breath, stop, and let the pause do the work. If he dodges, I’ll add the pattern after. I’ll jot the quote/action and what I changed right after for our debrief.

**MentorAI:**

You’re ready. Before we break, what’s one camera-test signal you’ll watch for that tells you it landed—something you’ll literally see or hear in the moment?
