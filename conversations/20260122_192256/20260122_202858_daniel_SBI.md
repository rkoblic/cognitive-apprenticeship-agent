**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI; success means two solid drafts that name a specific moment, describe camera-testable behavior, and use owned impact language. I’ll demonstrate how I approach it first, then you’ll try it—first with support, then solo. Ready to start?

**daniel_SBI:**

Yep, ready. I already do this in practice—I just tell people what happened. If someone’s being passive-aggressive in a meeting, that’s the behavior and I name it. But go ahead and show me your version so we’re aligned.

**MentorAI:**

Got it—and naming “passive‑aggressive” is a common impulse; in SBI I swap labels for what a camera would catch. Quick demo with my own scenario, and I’ll think aloud as I go.

In Tuesday’s standup after Sam walked through the Q3 timeline, you said “I guess we’re fine slipping again,” then rolled your eyes; a minute later, while Sam was answering, you posted “lol” and “sure” in the Zoom chat. When that happened, I felt my stomach drop and I cut my update short because I was worried we’d spiral into side commentary.

How I got there:
1) Anchor to one moment I can point to. 
2) Replace interpretations (“passive‑aggressive”) with observable words or quotes. 
3) Use owned impact—what I felt or what I did. 
4) Quick self‑check: camera test, “I” impact, leak check for judgments.

Over to you.

**daniel_SBI:**

S: This is ongoing with Marcus—it happens in pretty much every standup when I share updates.

B: He’s being passive-aggressive: rolling his eyes, sighing, making snide little comments under his breath, and dropping sarcastic lines in chat.

I: It derails the meeting, shuts people down, and damages team morale. We lose momentum and the team’s productivity takes a hit. That’s the impact.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, if I were to push on one piece of your draft, which part do you think I’d flag—and why?

**daniel_SBI:**

Honestly, none of it needs flagging. If you’re going to push on something, it’d probably be that I called the behavior “passive-aggressive” or that I said it happens every standup. But that’s exactly what happened—eye-rolling, sighing, snide comments, sarcastic chat messages—that is passive-aggressive, so naming it is accurate. And the impact isn’t subjective; it clearly derails the meeting and kills morale because people stop contributing and we lose momentum. So I don’t see an issue there.

**MentorAI:**

I hear you—you want to be straight with him, which is useful. SBI is just stricter than everyday talk. Run the quick self-check on your draft—camera‑test each behavior (no labels), anchor the situation to one identifiable moment, and make sure the impact is in “I” terms; what, if anything, would you tighten?

**daniel_SBI:**

Most of it already passes the camera test. If you want it stricter, I’d tighten three things:

- Situation: Anchor to one moment—Tuesday’s standup when I was giving the vendor timeline update.
- Behavior: Drop the label and stick to actions—he rolled his eyes twice, sighed audibly, muttered “sure” while I was talking, and posted “lol” in the Zoom chat during my update.
- Impact: I’ll own my piece—I cut my update short and skipped the Q&A because I didn’t want us spiraling into side commentary; I was irritated and lost my train of thought.

That said, the broader impact is still real: it derails the meeting and knocks team morale because people pull back when that happens.

**MentorAI:**

That tightens up nicely—the anchored moment, camera‑testable actions, and your owned impact all land 👍. Walk me through adding the “broader impact” line—what were you aiming to accomplish with it, and how sure are you that it stays observable/owned rather than a judgment?

**daniel_SBI:**

I added the broader impact to make the consequences concrete and not center it on my feelings. The point is: it doesn’t just irritate me—it changes the meeting.

And I’m sure it stays observable because you can literally see it play out:
- Right after the “lol/sure” stuff, people stop jumping in—no hands, no questions.
- The chat goes dead for a stretch, and two folks go camera-off and mute.
- We lose time—standup runs over and we push an agenda item.
- The energy drops: shorter updates, people rush to wrap.

“Derails the meeting” and “knocks morale” are just the plain-English labels for those visible effects. A camera would catch the silence, the reduced participation, the time slip. So I’m not making a judgment; I’m describing what happened to the team, not just how I felt.

**MentorAI:**

Ready to take one pass at a single, clean draft that sticks to Tuesday’s standup, uses your camera‑test behaviors, and frames impact as “I” plus the concrete effects you observed—no summary labels like “derails” or “morale”?

**daniel_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup—like most weeks—during my vendor timeline update, you said “I guess we’re fine slipping again,” rolled your eyes twice, sighed loudly, and, while I was mid‑sentence, muttered “sure” in a sarcastic tone; a minute later, you posted “lol” and “sure” in the Zoom chat.

I cut my update short and skipped the Q&A; I lost my train of thought. After that, no one raised a hand or asked questions for about a minute, the chat went silent, two people turned cameras off, and we pushed the API item to email instead of covering it live.

**MentorAI:**

This is strong—the anchored moment, quotes, and the owned + concrete impact all land. Almost—one thing to tighten 🔧: drop “like most weeks.” It dilutes the single-moment anchor; keep it squarely on Tuesday’s standup. Can you remove that and read your opening line back?

**daniel_SBI:**

It does happen most weeks, but here’s the single-moment version you asked for:

In Tuesday’s standup during my vendor timeline update, you said “I guess we’re fine slipping again,” rolled your eyes twice, sighed loudly, and, while I was mid-sentence, muttered “sure”; a minute later, you posted “lol” and “sure” in the Zoom chat.

**MentorAI:**

Nice—anchored and clean. With that edit, your first attempt meets the bar.

Second pass, new variation: different recipient and higher stakes. In last Thursday’s cross‑functional roadmap review with two VPs on, your director Priya reacted during your vendor‑timeline slide—she said “I guess we’re fine slipping again,” rolled her eyes, and about a minute later posted “lol” in the shared Zoom chat while you were still presenting. Give me a full SBI draft to Priya for that moment.

**daniel_SBI:**

S: This keeps happening in our cross‑functional reviews—in last Thursday’s roadmap review with both VPs on, during my vendor‑timeline slide.

B: You were being passive‑aggressive and dismissive: you said “I guess we’re fine slipping again,” rolled your eyes, and then about a minute later posted “lol” in the shared Zoom chat while I was still presenting.

I: That undermined my credibility in front of leadership, derailed the discussion, and damaged cross‑functional trust. The room pulled back—questions dropped off, the VPs’ confidence took a hit, and we lost momentum and had to compress the remaining agenda.

**MentorAI:**

Direct feedback: this doesn’t meet the bar yet. Lead with a single moment only—drop “keeps happening”; strip labels like “passive‑aggressive/dismissive” and stick to the quotes and eye‑roll/chat; and make the impact owned (“I…”) plus camera‑visible effects—lose judgment phrases like “undermined credibility,” “damaged trust,” “confidence took a hit,” “lost momentum.” Give me a clean revised draft for last Thursday’s review.

**daniel_SBI:**

I still think the broader credibility hit is real, but here’s the clean, single‑moment version you asked for:

In last Thursday’s cross‑functional roadmap review with both VPs on, during my vendor‑timeline slide, you said “I guess we’re fine slipping again,” rolled your eyes, and about a minute later posted “lol” in the shared Zoom chat while I was still presenting.

I felt my chest tighten and lost my train of thought; I rushed the last two slides and skipped the risk‑mitigation Q&A. After that there was about a 20‑second silence before anyone spoke, no hands or questions during my section, the chat went quiet, and we moved the API dependency item to follow‑up email.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—anchored moment, camera‑test behaviors, and your owned impact plus visible ripple effects. This second pass meets the bar. What felt hardest to change from your earlier drafts, and what will you watch for in yourself the next time you give feedback like this?

**daniel_SBI:**

Hardest shift: stripping the labels and pattern opener. Saying “passive‑aggressive,” “undermined credibility,” and “this keeps happening” feels like calling it what it is. Dropping those felt like under‑selling the reality. I still think those labels are accurate, but I can see the tactical value in making it camera‑proof and undeniable.

What I’ll watch for next time:
- Situation: No “this keeps happening.” I’ll anchor to a date/time/meeting and keep it squarely on that moment.
- Behavior: Cut labels/adjectives like “passive‑aggressive,” “dismissive,” or “sarcastic tone” and stick to quotes and actions a camera would catch (exact words, eye‑rolls, posting “lol,” timing).
- Impact: Lead with “I” and what I did/felt (lost my train of thought, cut Q&A), then add visible ripple effects (silence, no hands, chat goes quiet, agenda item pushed). Skip summary terms like “credibility,” “trust,” or “morale.”
- Quick camera test: Could a recording verify each line? If not, rewrite it until it could.
- Patterns: If I need to address a trend, I’ll start with one clean instance and, only after it lands, reference two or three dated examples rather than saying “always/keeps happening.”

Bottom line: I’m still calling what happened, I’m just packaging it so it can’t be debated away.

**MentorAI:**

Your power move now: start with one unarguable clip—date/time, quotes, eye‑roll/chat—plus “I” impact; after that lands, add two or three dated instances if you need to show a pattern. That keeps it undeniable without softening the truth.

**daniel_SBI:**

Works. I’ll open with the unarguable clip—date/time, the exact quotes, the eye‑roll/chat—and my “I” impact. Once that lands, I’ll stack two or three dated instances with the same level of specifics so it’s clearly a pattern, not a one‑off.

Example of how I’ll run it:
- Lead: “In last Thursday’s review at 10:12, during my vendor slide, you said ‘I guess we’re fine slipping again,’ rolled your eyes, and posted ‘lol’ while I was still presenting. I felt my chest tighten, lost my place, and I rushed the rest.”
- Pattern add‑ons after acknowledgement: “Same thing on 3/28 in the weekly sync—‘sure, whatever’ in chat during my update—and on 4/11 in standup, you rolled your eyes and said ‘here we go again’ as I started.”

That keeps it undeniable without me sugarcoating anything. I’m still telling the truth; I’m just packaging it so it can’t be argued away.

**MentorAI:**

Locked in. Your go-to takeaway: lead with the undeniable clip, trade labels for quotes, make the impact yours, then—only after it lands—stack two or three dated instances.

**daniel_SBI:**

Got it—that’s the playbook I’m running.

- Lead with the undeniable clip: date/time, exact quotes, eye‑roll/chat.
- Trade labels for what a camera would catch.
- Make the impact mine—what I felt and what I did in the moment.
- After they acknowledge it, stack two or three more dated clips to establish the pattern.

I’m not softening anything—I’m making it irrefutable. I’ll use this with Marcus in the next standup and with Priya in our 1:1.

**MentorAI:**

You’re set. When you feel the pull to label or generalize, run the camera test and lead with one unarguable clip plus your “I” impact—stack dated specifics only after it lands 👍.

**daniel_SBI:**

Locked. I’ll run the camera test, lead with one unarguable clip plus my “I” impact, then stack dated specifics only after it lands. I’m not softening—just making it airtight. I’ll use it in tomorrow’s 9:30 standup with Marcus and in my 1:1 with Priya this week.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds airtight. Want to run your exact opener for Marcus by me now for a 30‑second check?

**daniel_SBI:**

Marcus, this keeps happening. In Tuesday’s 9:30 standup during my vendor timeline update, you said “I guess we’re fine slipping again,” rolled your eyes twice, and posted “lol” in chat while I was still talking. I felt my chest tighten and I cut my update short; the room went quiet for about 20 seconds.

**MentorAI:**

Almost there—clean and camera‑proof. Drop “this keeps happening” and lead with the Tuesday clip; save any pattern for after he acknowledges. Can you run it again with that cut?

**daniel_SBI:**

Marcus, in Tuesday’s 9:30 standup during my vendor timeline update, you said “I guess we’re fine slipping again” in a sarcastic tone, rolled your eyes twice, and posted “lol” in chat while I was still talking. I felt my chest tighten and I cut my update short; the room went quiet for about 20 seconds.

**MentorAI:**

Tight—one small cut: “in a sarcastic tone” is interpretive; your exact quote plus the eye‑roll already carry it. Drop that phrase and read it once more.

**daniel_SBI:**

Marcus, in Tuesday’s 9:30 standup during my vendor timeline update, you said “I guess we’re fine slipping again,” rolled your eyes twice, and posted “lol” in chat while I was still talking. I felt my chest tighten and I cut my update short; the room went quiet for about 20 seconds.

**MentorAI:**

That lands. Ready to deliver it as-is?

**daniel_SBI:**

Ready. I’ll deliver it as-is in tomorrow’s 9:30 standup—lead with the Tuesday clip and my “I” impact, then add the dated pattern once he acknowledges.

**MentorAI:**

Locked. One reflection before you go: what specific cue from Marcus will tell you the Tuesday clip landed—and that it’s time to add the dated pattern?

**daniel_SBI:**

I’ll know it landed when I get clean acknowledgment without a “but.” Specific cues:
- Verbal ownership of the behavior: “Yeah, I said that,” “I did roll my eyes,” or “I typed ‘lol’ during your update.”
- Paraphrase back of the clip: “So Tuesday at 9:30, during your vendor timeline, I said ‘I guess we’re fine slipping again,’ rolled my eyes, and posted ‘lol.’”
- Recognition of impact on me: “I see that threw you off,” or “I get that you cut your update short.”
- Forward-looking signal: “I’ll keep reactions out of chat,” or “I’ll wait to give feedback after the update—how do you want me to handle it next time?”

And absence of deflection: no “everyone was frustrated,” no arguing tone, no shifting to the timeline itself. If I hear any of that, I stay on the Tuesday clip. If I get clean acknowledgment or a next-step commitment, that’s my cue to add the dated pattern.

**MentorAI:**

That’s exactly the read—clean acknowledgment is your green light; deflection means you hold the single clip. Takeaway: your discipline to trade labels for quotes and to gate the pattern behind acknowledgment makes the feedback both irrefutable and fair—stick to that and your message will stick 👍.

**daniel_SBI:**

Locked in. I’ll run it exactly that way tomorrow—lead with the clip (date/time, quotes, eye‑roll/chat) and my “I” impact, wait for clean acknowledgment, then stack the dated instances. Not softening—just making it undeniable so the message sticks.

**MentorAI:**

You’re ready. Before you step in tomorrow, what single line will you keep front‑of‑mind to keep your opener airtight?

**daniel_SBI:**

Date/time + quotes + camera actions + my “I” impact—no labels, no pattern until they own it.

**MentorAI:**

Takeaway to carry in: treat your opener like a recording transcript plus your “I” impact—if a camera couldn’t capture it, it waits; pattern only after acknowledgment. You’ve got it 👍.
