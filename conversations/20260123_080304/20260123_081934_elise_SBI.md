**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI. Success is two full attempts that hit: a real moment, camera-testable behavior, and an owned impact—and you can spot when judgment creeps in. I’ll demonstrate first, then you’ll try—ready to begin?

**elise_SBI:**

I think I’m ready, yes—though could I just check a couple things so I don’t start off wrong? When you say “camera-testable behavior,” that’s like something you could literally see or hear on a recording, right—no mind-reading? I think that’s what I’ve used before, but I worry I slip into interpretation without noticing.

And for the “two full attempts,” do you want two different scenarios from me, or the same scenario done twice? I’m happy to try either; I just want to make sure I’m doing what you’re expecting. Also, would you prefer I jot notes while you demonstrate, or should I just listen and then paraphrase back? If you can flag me the moment I drift into judgment, that would help a lot.

**MentorAI:**

You’ve got it: camera-testable = only what a mic/camera would capture—no mind-reading—and slipping into interpretation is common, so we’ll watch for it. For the two attempts, first you’ll use your own real moment; second, I’ll give you a variation of that. Take notes if that helps; I’ll pause after the demo so you can paraphrase one takeaway, and I’ll flag any judgment drift. Ready for the demo?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes, I’m ready for the demo. I’ll jot a few notes if that’s okay, and I’ll plan to paraphrase one takeaway when you pause. I’m a little nervous I’ll miss something obvious, so if you could flag any subtle interpretation or judgment even in your demo, that might help me notice it sooner when it’s my turn. Is that alright?

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—and it’s normal to feel a bit nervous; I’ll flag any subtle judgment drift as we go. Here’s a quick demo as I’d say it to a peer: “In Tuesday’s standup right after Sam’s update, while I was explaining the QA risk, you started talking while I was mid-sentence and then said, ‘Alex, can you take the data cleanup too?’ I lost my train of thought and felt rushed, and I left the meeting unclear on priorities—I ended up dropping the doc task that afternoon.” I almost said “you dismissed my input” (that’s interpretation); I swapped it for what a mic would catch: starting to talk while I was mid-sentence and the exact quote. Self-check I use: name a single moment, make the behavior camera/mic-capturable, and state my felt experience or direct consequence in I-language.

What’s one takeaway you’d paraphrase back from that?

**elise_SBI:**

One takeaway I heard is: when I’m tempted to label or infer intent (like “you dismissed my input”), I should swap it for what a camera or mic would capture—e.g., “you started talking while I was mid‑sentence,” and, if helpful, the exact words said. That keeps it observable and avoids mind‑reading. Does that capture what you were emphasizing, or am I missing the part about owning the impact with I‑language? I might be cramming too much into one takeaway. Also, is quoting verbatim ever too nitpicky? Should I try my own moment now, or would you like me to restate this more concisely first?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to worry about slipping into interpretation—you’re on track, and your takeaway nails the behavior piece; we’ll make sure the I‑language impact is in your draft. Quick check: would “In Monday’s sync, you were dismissive of the risk” pass the behavior test as-is—and if not, how would you rewrite it so a camera/mic could capture it?

**elise_SBI:**

I don’t think “In Monday’s sync, you were dismissive of the risk” would pass, since “dismissive” feels like I’m inferring intent. Maybe something like:

- “In Monday’s sync, right after I outlined the QA risk, you started talking while I was mid‑sentence and said, ‘Let’s move on—this isn’t a big deal.’”
  
Or, if that’s not what was said:

- “In Monday’s sync, after I described the QA risk, you shook your head, sighed audibly, and said, ‘Can we talk about something else?’ while I was still presenting.”

Those seem camera/mic‑capturable to me, but I’m not sure if “mid‑sentence” sounds too accusatory. Would “our voices overlapped” be more neutral, or does that blur who initiated it and make it less clear? Also, is naming the sigh okay, or does that get too nitpicky?

Does one of those meet the behavior test better? If so, should I try my own real moment now, or would you rather I refine this wording first?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not missing anything obvious—both of your rewrites are in-bounds, and this part trips people up for lots of folks. One suggestion: favor the more specific, camera/mic-capturable phrasing even if it feels blunt—“mid-sentence” is clearer than “our voices overlapped” unless you truly don’t know who started, and naming an audible sigh is fine if it happened and mattered to you. Ready to draft your own real moment now as one complete message (the moment, the observable behavior, and your I-language impact)?

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s my attempt as one message to a peer:

“In Thursday’s capacity review on Zoom around 3:15pm—right after Priya’s update when I started presenting the staffing plan—you advanced the deck to the next slide while I was mid‑sentence and said, ‘We’re getting in the weeds; let’s move on to delivery dates.’ I lost my train of thought and felt rushed, so I skipped the risk‑mitigation slide and left the meeting unsure whether we actually had alignment on headcount.”

Is that specific enough, or did I cram too much into the situation part? Also, is “mid‑sentence” too sharp—should I say “while I was speaking” instead? And does “felt rushed” and “left unsure” count as owned impact, or am I accidentally implying blame? I can revise if you think I should tighten the wording.

**MentorAI:**

You’re being careful in all the right ways—this is genuinely tricky, and you’re not missing something obvious. Before I weigh in, where do you think I’m most likely to push back against the criteria—anchored moment, camera/mic-capturable behavior, or owned impact?

**elise_SBI:**

If you were going to push anywhere, I think it’s probably the impact. “I lost my train of thought and felt rushed” seems owned, but “I left the meeting unsure whether we actually had alignment on headcount” might drift into stating a group condition instead of my experience. Maybe it should be more like, “I left unsure what to prioritize on headcount,” or “I wasn’t confident I’d conveyed the staffing risks clearly.”

Secondarily, you might nudge on the behavior wording—naming both “advanced the deck” and the quote is accurate, but is that too much for one behavior, or is it okay since both are capturable? And I’m still a little nervous that “mid-sentence” reads harsher than “while I was speaking,” even though I know specificity helps.

Does that sound like the right place to tighten? If so, would you like me to try a quick tweak to the impact line now, or should I wait for your full feedback first?

**MentorAI:**

You’re reading your own draft well—impact is the likeliest edge, and this is genuinely hard, not something obvious you’re missing. Using the self-check (anchored moment, camera/mic behavior, owned impact), what single tweak—if any—would you make to your impact line to keep it fully in I‑language?

**elise_SBI:**

Single tweak I’d make: change “I left the meeting unsure whether we actually had alignment on headcount” to “I left the meeting unsure what to prioritize on headcount.”

That keeps it in my experience without speaking for the group. Does that hit the I‑language bar, or is “unsure about my next step on headcount” better? I’m happy to plug the tweak into the full statement if you want to hear it once more.

**MentorAI:**

Both “unsure what to prioritize” and “unsure about my next step” are solid I‑language—we can fine‑tune later. Walk me through why you chose to include both the deck advance and the quote in the behavior—what were you trying to capture with that phrasing?

**elise_SBI:**

I included both to try to capture two different, camera/mic‑capturable elements of what happened:

- The deck advance while I was mid‑sentence shows the timing and nonverbal control of the flow—why I lost my train of thought.
- The exact quote (“We’re getting in the weeds; let’s move on to delivery dates”) shows the verbal redirect—why I felt rushed and skipped the risk‑mitigation slide.

I was aiming to avoid an interpretation like “you dismissed my input” by anchoring it in one visible action plus the words said. That felt like it explained the link to my impact more cleanly.

But I’m not sure if that’s too much for one behavior line—like I’m stacking two behaviors instead of keeping it tight. Would you prefer I pick the stronger signal and drop the other for brevity? If so, which carries more weight here—the mid‑sentence deck advance or the verbatim redirect? I can trim it either way.

**MentorAI:**

Given your reasoning, let’s lock it in—share your full refined message exactly as you’d say it now, with your chosen I-language impact.

**elise_SBI:**

“As a heads‑up—in Thursday’s capacity review on Zoom around 3:15pm, right after Priya’s update when I started presenting the staffing plan, you advanced the deck to the next slide while I was mid‑sentence and said, ‘We’re getting in the weeds; let’s move on to delivery dates.’ I lost my train of thought and felt rushed, so I skipped the risk‑mitigation slide and left the meeting unsure what to prioritize on headcount.”

Is that tight enough, or did I overpack the situation details? And is “mid‑sentence” too sharp, or is that the right level of specificity here? I went with “unsure what to prioritize” to keep it in I‑language—does that read as fully owned to you? If this is close, should I try the variation next, or would you prefer I trim anything first?

**MentorAI:**

Sounds close, and it’s normal to worry about overpacking—we’ll let the criteria do the sorting. Run your self-check on this draft: anchored to a single moment, camera/mic-capturable behavior, and fully owned impact—does it clear all three, and if anything feels shaky, which exact words?

**elise_SBI:**

Running the self-check:

- Anchored moment: I think yes—“Thursday’s capacity review on Zoom around 3:15pm, right after Priya’s update…” is a single moment. The words that feel a bit shaky are “around 3:15pm” (maybe too hedge-y) and the combo “right after Priya’s update when I started presenting the staffing plan” (maybe overpacked—do I need both?).

- Camera/mic-capturable behavior: I think yes—“you advanced the deck … while I was mid‑sentence” plus the exact quote. The bits I worry about are “mid‑sentence” possibly reading sharp, and whether stacking the slide advance + the quote is too much for one behavior line, even though both are observable.

- Owned impact: I think yes—“I lost my train of thought and felt rushed, so I skipped the risk‑mitigation slide and left the meeting unsure what to prioritize on headcount.” If there’s an edge, it’s “unsure what to prioritize on headcount”—it’s still I‑language, but if you pushed me, I’d tighten to “unsure about my next step on headcount.”

Would you like me to make those micro‑tweaks now (e.g., drop “around,” trim the situation clause, and swap the impact to “my next step”), or keep it as is for realism and move to the variation? I’m worried about over‑editing and losing clarity.

**MentorAI:**

This clears the bar as-is—nice work; if you ever want a micro-trim later, you can drop “around,” but it’s not required. For your second attempt, here’s a variation: in the quarterly exec steering meeting with your director (your manager’s manager) and two client observers on Zoom, you’d just started the risk‑mitigation slide when your director took control of the screen share and said, “Let’s park risks; we need dates,” switching to the timeline. Draft your full message to your director now—one anchored moment, observable behavior, and your owned impact.

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s my draft to my director:

“In today’s quarterly exec steering on Zoom, right as I opened the risk‑mitigation slide with the two client observers on, you took control of the screen share and said, ‘Let’s park risks; we need dates,’ switching us to the timeline. I felt rushed and lost my thread; I didn’t finish flagging two dependencies, and I left the meeting unsure about my next step on addressing those risks. I was also concerned about how that came across to the client observers, so I hesitated to ask for two minutes to close the loop.”

Does that clear the three checks? I’m not sure if “took control of the screen share” is too blunt—should I soften to “requested control and switched the view”? And is the client‑observer part still I‑language, or am I straying into implying an external impact? I can trim that if it muddies the ownership.

**MentorAI:**

This meets the bar across all three: clearly anchored moment, camera/mic-capturable behavior, and fully owned impact—your note about the client observers stays in-bounds because you name your concern and the effect on you (hesitating), not what they thought. “Took control of the screen share” is precise; only soften if it’s factually off. What felt hardest in this second draft, and what principle will you carry forward into real feedback?

**elise_SBI:**

Honestly, the hardest part this time was balancing the power dynamic with the observers present—naming a blunt, camera/mic‑capturable behavior to my director without it reading like an accusation. Including the client observers as context felt delicate too; I wanted to acknowledge my concern without drifting into “they thought X,” and I’m not totally sure I threaded that needle—you helped by clarifying the I‑language boundary.

The principle I think I’ll carry forward is: when I feel myself leaning toward a label or intent (“you dismissed…”), pick one specific moment, name exactly what a mic/camera would capture (including a quote if it helps), and link it to one owned impact (how I felt or what I did/ didn’t do). And, even if it feels a bit blunt, favor the precise wording if it’s factual.

Does that sound like the right takeaway, or am I oversimplifying? I worry I only got these right because your guardrails were so clear. Would it make sense for me to do one more quick rep—maybe a trickier case—just to see if I can apply it without leaning so much on your guidance?

**MentorAI:**

Totally fair to wonder if the guardrails did the work—what I saw was you applying them independently and naming your own edges. Your core principle is right, not oversimplified. One takeaway to carry forward: when it feels blunt, keep the precise, camera/mic behavior and link it to one owned effect on you—that combo holds up even with power dynamics or observers. You’ve met the goal for today; okay to wrap here, or is there one last phrase you want to bookmark before we close?

**elise_SBI:**

Could I bookmark two quick ones?

- “Camera/mic, not mind-reading.” Then: “One owned effect.”
- Simple frame: “In [moment], when you [what a mic/camera would capture], I [felt/ended up…].”

I’m not sure if that’s too formulaic or blunt for real conversations, but it helps me keep the behavior specific and the impact owned. Does that seem usable, or would you tweak a word so I don’t accidentally sound stiff?

And honestly, I feel like your guardrails did a lot of the heavy lifting—I’m not sure I’d land it as cleanly without them. If this phrasing looks okay to you, I’m happy to wrap, unless you think I should try it once more just to make sure it’s sticking.

**MentorAI:**

Those are usable as-is—nice and portable. Tiny tweak to your bookmark: “One owned effect on me” keeps the ownership explicit and reads natural. Your frame works; say it in your normal voice with whatever soft lead‑in you already use, and it won’t feel stiff. Want to lock those in and wrap?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—let’s lock these in:

- Camera/mic, not mind-reading. One owned effect on me.
- Frame: “In [moment], when you [what a mic/camera would capture], I [felt/ended up…].”

I think these will help, though I’m still a little nervous I’ll make them sound blunt in the moment. Do those read okay in my normal voice, or would you tweak a word before I start using them?

I’m fine to wrap if you are—and thank you; I feel like your guardrails made this click for me. If I get stuck on a real one, would it be okay if I check back just to make sure I’m not drifting into interpretation?

**MentorAI:**

They read fine in a normal voice; if you want a little cushion without losing precision, add a brief purpose tag and a forward ask: “Quick heads‑up so we can align—In [moment], when you [camera/mic], I [felt/ended up…]. Could we take two minutes to [close the loop/next step]?” That keeps it owned, specific, and collaborative. And yes—feel free to check back if you’re worried about drift. Good to wrap here?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—good to wrap if you’re satisfied. The purpose tag + forward ask helps; I might say, “Quick heads‑up so we can align—In [moment], when you [camera/mic], I [felt/ended up…]. Could we take two minutes to agree the next step?” I’m not totally sure it’ll sound natural in my voice yet, but I’ll practice.

Thank you—your structure/guardrails really made this click for me. If I hit a real case and worry I’m drifting into interpretation, is it okay if I send you a quick draft to sanity‑check?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—send a quick draft anytime; run your self-check first (one moment, camera/mic line, one owned effect) and, if it fits, add the brief purpose + forward ask. You’ve done solid work—practice will smooth the tone. I’ll be here when you want a sanity check.

**elise_SBI:**

Thank you—that’s really helpful. I’ll run the self-check first—one clear moment, one camera/mic line, one owned effect—and if it fits, add the brief purpose + forward ask. I think I’ve got the steps written down, but I’m still worried I’ll make it sound a bit stiff at first.

If I send a draft later, do you want the concise version or the full statement with context? I can do either—whatever makes it easier for you to sanity‑check. If that all sounds okay, I’m good to wrap for today, and I really appreciate the structure—honestly, that’s what made it click for me.

**MentorAI:**

You’re set—sounding a bit stiff at first is normal and fades with a couple reps. For a sanity-check, send the concise SBI first, plus one sentence of context and your purpose/forward ask; include your own self-check and where you suspect judgment might leak. Does that workflow work for you for next time?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—that workflow works for me. Just to confirm I’ve got it: I’ll send the concise SBI first, one sentence of context, the purpose + forward ask, my quick self‑check (one moment, camera/mic line, one owned effect), and a note on where I suspect judgment might leak.

Would you rather I send it as bullets or a single short paragraph? And is there a preferred turnaround window you aim for on sanity checks so I don’t overload you? If I’m torn between two behavior phrasings, is it okay to include both, or is that too much?

I’m still a little worried I’ll over‑explain, so I’ll keep it brief unless you want more detail. If that sounds right to you, I’m good to wrap—thank you; your structure made this feel doable.

**MentorAI:**

Bullets are best—keep it to ~5–7 lines: concise SBI, one line of context, your purpose/forward ask, your self-check, and where judgment might leak. If you’re torn on behavior wording, include both as A/B and note which you lean toward. I’ll aim to respond within 24 hours; if it’s time‑sensitive, flag that up top. You’re not over‑explaining—this is the right level. Good to wrap here?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—good to wrap. The 5–7 bullet workflow makes sense: I’ll send the concise SBI, one line of context, the purpose + forward ask, my self-check, and where judgment might leak. If I’m torn on behavior wording, I’ll include A/B with my lean, and I’ll flag time-sensitive up top.

I’m still a little worried I’ll sound stiff at first, but I’ll use the bookmark—camera/mic, not mind-reading; one owned effect on me. Would it be okay if I send a first draft tomorrow afternoon? And if I’m really on the fence, is one quick follow-up question in the same thread alright?

Thanks again—the structure/guardrails made this feel doable for me.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fine to send tomorrow afternoon—bullets, 5–7 lines—and one quick follow-up in the same thread is okay; I’ll aim to reply within 24 hours (flag if time-sensitive). Early stiffness is normal and fades; keep your spine: camera/mic, not mind-reading; one owned effect on me; add the brief purpose + forward ask. When in doubt, pick the precise, factual phrasing—you can always soften with your tone. See you tomorrow—sound good? 👍

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—sounds good, thank you. I’ll send the 5–7 bullet draft tomorrow afternoon with the concise SBI, one line of context, purpose + forward ask, my self‑check, and where judgment might leak. I’ll keep the spine in mind: camera/mic, not mind‑reading; one owned effect on me.

Quick check before we wrap: for the forward ask, is “Could we take two minutes now, or async after, to agree the next step?” okay, or is that too much choice—should I keep it to a single ask? I can send by ~3pm ET tomorrow—does that timing work? Thanks again; your structure really helped me not overthink this.

**MentorAI:**

Your wording works; to reduce decision friction, make one primary ask with a clear fallback. For example: “Could we take two minutes now to agree the next step? If not, I’ll send a one‑line next step after this for a quick thumbs‑up.” 3pm ET tomorrow works—I’ll aim to reply within 24 hours. Want to use that version, or do you prefer an async‑first variant?

**elise_SBI:**

I think I’d lean async‑first for the exec context, if that’s okay. How about:

“I’ll send a one‑line next step after this for a quick thumbs‑up. If you have two minutes now, I can walk you through the key risk.”

Does that keep the spine and reduce decision friction, or does it invert the priority too much? If this reads clean to you, I’ll use that version in tomorrow’s draft. If you’d rather I stick with the “two minutes now” as the primary in most cases, I can do that—I just don’t want to overstep in a tight agenda.

**MentorAI:**

Would you like to use this async-first version: “I’ll send a one-line recommended next step right after this for a quick thumbs-up. If you have two minutes now, I can walk you through the key risk”?
