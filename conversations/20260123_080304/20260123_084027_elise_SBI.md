**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI. Success means you anchor to a real moment, describe observable behavior, use owned impact language—and can spot when judgment has crept in. I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll switch to your turn; ready to start?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—at least, I think I’m ready. Seeing your demo first would really help me make sure I’m not accidentally mixing in judgment. Is it okay if I ask a quick clarifying question or two while you go, or would you rather I save them until the end? And when it’s my turn, could we maybe do the steps one at a time at first, just to make sure I’m doing it right?

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to feel cautious here—judgment sneaks in for everyone at first. I’ll run a quick demo straight through; jot any clarifiers and we’ll handle them right after. And when it’s your turn, we’ll do one full draft first, then refine—that’s how you build the muscle, not step-by-step.

Here’s the demo. In Tuesday’s standup, while I was giving the deployment update, you started talking at the same time and continued for about 20 seconds, and I stopped mid-sentence. I felt flustered and lost my place; we ran out of time and I skipped the rollback note, and I spent 10 minutes after answering two pings to clarify. I’m anchoring to one identifiable moment (not “lately”), keeping the behavior camera-testable (no motives or labels like “dismissive”), and using owned impact (“I felt flustered” and a concrete consequence) rather than “that was unprofessional.”

Pause there—take a beat. If you’ve got a quick clarifier, share it now; otherwise say “ready” and we’ll move on.

**elise_SBI:**

Quick clarifier: in your impact, you paired an emotion (“I felt flustered”) with concrete fallout (skipping the rollback note and the two follow-up pings). Is it okay to combine those in one impact piece, or should operational consequences be separate?

Also, the “about 20 seconds” detail—does that level of specificity usually help anchor it, or can it come off as nitpicky?

If that’s on the right track, I’m ready to try a full draft—could you keep an eye out in case I slip some judgment in without noticing? Ready.

**MentorAI:**

Good questions. Yes—pairing an emotion with the immediate consequence is not just okay; it often makes the impact clearer. Keep it owned and specific to you (I felt X; I missed Y; I spent Z), not evaluations like “it was disrespectful.” On specificity: include just enough to anchor recognition; rough, non-arguable details are helpful, while hyper-precise numbers can feel like scorekeeping unless timing is the point.

Your turn: give me a full draft (2–4 sentences) from a real moment—anchor the situation, describe only what a camera would see, and name your felt impact and/or concrete fallout. I’ll watch for any judgment leaks; share it when you’re ready.

**elise_SBI:**

Okay—here’s a draft. In last Thursday’s ops sync at 11am, while I was summarizing dependencies for Release 12, you dragged three tickets from “Ready” to “In Progress” on the shared board and the room shifted to discussing those items. I felt rushed and a bit sidelined, and we didn’t get to the vendor change item; I spent about 15 minutes after the meeting updating the plan in Jira and DM’ing Maya to realign.

Is that specific enough, or does “three tickets” feel like scorekeeping? And is “sidelined” too loaded—should I say “less included” or something more neutral? I can try a different example if this one isn’t ideal—do you want me to tweak this or try another draft?

**MentorAI:**

You’re reading this the right way—careful without spiraling. Before I weigh in, pick one spot you think could drift into judgment—either “three tickets” or “sidelined”—and propose a tweak that keeps it true while staying camera‑testable/owned; what would you change, if anything?

**elise_SBI:**

I’ll pick “sidelined.” I could tweak that to: “I felt rushed and lost my place in the dependency summary,” instead of “a bit sidelined.” That keeps it owned and specific to my experience—does that land better? Or is “lost my place” too strong; would “it was harder for me to finish summarizing the dependencies” be safer?

If that’s reasonable, should I swap it in and read the full draft again? And on “three tickets,” would you keep it as-is or soften to “a few tickets” to avoid sounding like I’m keeping score? Sorry if I’m overthinking this.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—this is exactly the kind of precision that pays off. “I felt rushed and lost my place in the dependency summary” lands better than “it was harder to finish…” because it’s owned and specific. Keep everything else as-is for now; we’ll revisit the ticket detail next. Swap that line in and share the full draft again 👍

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s the full draft with the tweak:

In last Thursday’s ops sync at 11am, while I was summarizing dependencies for Release 12, you dragged three tickets from “Ready” to “In Progress” on the shared board and the room shifted to discussing those items. I felt rushed and lost my place in the dependency summary; we didn’t get to the vendor change item, and I spent about 15 minutes after the meeting updating the plan in Jira and DM’ing Maya to realign.

Does that read as owned and specific enough? Is “about 15 minutes” helpful or does it start to feel like scorekeeping? And for next pass, would you keep “three tickets” or soften to “a few”? I can revise it again—your note on owned language really helped me swap that line, but I’m not sure I’ve got the balance quite right yet. Should I try another version?

**MentorAI:**

You’re tuning the right edges—questioning those details is exactly how this gets crisp. If I were to push back anywhere in your draft now, where do you think it would be, and why?

**elise_SBI:**

If you were going to push back, I think it would be on a couple of places that could read as scorekeeping or a bit interpretive:

- “Three tickets” and “about 15 minutes” might be more precision than the point needs—so maybe “a few tickets” and “I spent time after the meeting” would keep it anchored without sounding like I’m keeping tally? I’m not sure if that weakens the clarity though.

- “The room shifted to discussing those items” could be a little interpretive. A cleaner camera-test might be “the team began discussing those items” or “the group focused on those items for the next part of the meeting.” Does that land better?

- Possibly naming “DM’ing Maya” brings in another person unnecessarily—maybe “I followed up after to realign with our PM” keeps the consequence without triangling someone in?

Am I looking in the right places? If so, which one would you nudge first? I can try a revision, but I don’t want to over-edit if the original was acceptable.

**MentorAI:**

You’re looking in the right places—this level of care isn’t overthinking; it’s craft. Run a quick self-check on your draft: 1) is the moment recognizable, 2) would a camera see the behavior as written, 3) is the impact owned and specific to you; then make the smallest change you think strengthens it and share the revised full draft.

**elise_SBI:**

Quick self-check:
1) Recognizable moment: Last Thursday’s ops sync at 11am, during the dependency summary—so I think yes.
2) Camera-testable behavior: “Dragged three tickets…” is observable; “the room shifted…” might be interpretive.
3) Owned, specific impact: “I felt rushed and lost my place… we didn’t get to X… I spent about 15 minutes…”—that feels owned and concrete.

Smallest change I think strengthens it: replace “the room shifted to discussing those items” with “the team began discussing those items.”

Revised draft:
In last Thursday’s ops sync at 11am, while I was summarizing dependencies for Release 12, you dragged three tickets from “Ready” to “In Progress” on the shared board, and the team began discussing those items. I felt rushed and lost my place in the dependency summary; we didn’t get to the vendor change item, and I spent about 15 minutes after the meeting updating the plan in Jira and DM’ing Maya to realign.

Does that hit the three checks better? Should I also soften “about 15 minutes” or leave it since timing isn’t the main point? And do you want me to keep “three tickets” for now or adjust it here too? I can tweak again if you think I should.

**MentorAI:**

This meets the bar—owned, specific, and camera-testable; “three tickets” and “about 15 minutes” read as non‑arguable, so you can keep them.

Second round, higher stakes: In Monday’s cross‑functional go/no‑go for Release 12 on Zoom, while you were presenting the risk slide, your senior engineering manager edited the board; the VP and vendor were in the room and the group pivoted to those items. Give me a full SBI draft for that moment (2–4 sentences), straight through—no scaffolding this time.

**elise_SBI:**

In Monday’s cross‑functional go/no‑go for Release 12 on Zoom, while I was presenting the risk slide and the VP and vendor were on, you moved two items on the shared board from “Ready” to “In Progress” and added a comment; the group began discussing those items. I felt flustered and lost my place in the risk narrative, and we skipped the rollback checkpoint. After the call, I spent about 20 minutes updating the deck and board notes and replied to two follow‑ups from the VP and the vendor to clarify what changed.

Does that hit the mark, or do “two items” and “about 20 minutes” veer into scorekeeping here? And is “risk narrative” too jargony—should I just say “I lost my place on the slide”? I can revise if you think I should tighten or neutralize any of that.

**MentorAI:**

That lands. You anchored to a clear moment with real stakes, the behavior is camera‑testable, and your impact is owned and concrete; nothing reads as judgment. “Two items” and “about 20 minutes” are non‑arguable and proportional here, not scorekeeping. “Risk narrative” is fine if that’s common in your org; if not, “on the risk slide” is the plainer option.

Quick look back: what felt hardest about drafting this version, and what will you carry forward next time you’re giving feedback in a high‑stakes meeting?

**elise_SBI:**

Honestly, the hardest part was doing it straight through without pausing to sanity‑check each piece. I kept second‑guessing whether I was sliding in motive (“undermined”) instead of sticking with camera‑testable behavior (“moved items on the board”). I also worried about how specific to be—counts and minutes felt helpful, but I didn’t want it to sound like I was keeping score. And with the VP and vendor there, I hesitated about naming the impact on me without it sounding like I was blaming.

What I think I’ll carry forward is that quick mental checklist you gave me: anchor to a single recognizable moment, describe only what the camera would see, and own the impact—pair an “I felt” with the concrete fallout. Also, swapping interpretive phrases (“the room shifted”) for something observable (“the group began discussing those items”), and using rough, non‑arguable specifics when they serve clarity. I think that’s the right takeaway… but I’m not totally sure I could keep it concise under pressure. Do you have a tip for trimming it on the fly?

And would it make sense to try one more high‑stakes example—maybe a shorter, two‑sentence version—just to make sure this wasn’t a fluke from your really clear guidance?

**MentorAI:**

Makes sense—wanting to sanity‑check and avoid implying motive is a real pull in high‑stakes rooms. For trimming on the fly, use a one‑breath, four‑beat line: in [specific moment], when you [single observable verb], I [felt X] and [direct consequence I handled]. If a number or time helps recognition, keep it; if it starts to feel like tallying, drop it—clarity over completeness.

Takeaway to carry forward: one moment, one verb, one owned impact. That’s what keeps it concise and judgment‑free under pressure.

**elise_SBI:**

That “one moment, one verb, one owned impact” line makes it feel a lot more doable—thank you. I think I get it, though I’m still a little unsure how to pick the single verb when there are a couple of camera‑testable actions happening at once. For example, if someone both moved items on the board and added a comment, would you default to the first disruption (“moved items on the board”) and let the rest go, or is there a rule of thumb for choosing?

If it’s okay, could I try one one‑breath pass using that four‑beat structure—super short—and you tell me if I kept it clean? I can use the Zoom go/no‑go example or a different moment, whichever you think is better for practice.

**MentorAI:**

Good instinct to ask about choosing the verb. Rule of thumb: default to the first action that triggered your impact; if there are two, pick the one the recipient most directly controls and will recognize instantly—only add the second as a short clause if it still fits in one breath. Try a one‑sentence, four‑beat version from the Zoom go/no‑go using that choice; I’m listening.

**elise_SBI:**

In Monday’s go/no‑go for Release 12 on Zoom, when you moved two items on the shared board, I felt flustered and lost my place on the risk slide, and I updated the deck afterward to clarify.

Does that stay within the four beats cleanly, or is “two items” too much for a one‑breath line? And should I have named that the VP and vendor were on, or is that extra in this format? If it helps, I can try a second pass—maybe adding “and added a comment” if it still fits, unless that muddies the single‑verb rule.

**MentorAI:**

That one-breath version works as-is—clean four beats. When you need to trim, use the breath test: keep one verb (moved), and if breath gets tight, drop modifiers like counts or who’s on the call before adding anything else—skip “and added a comment.” Your turn—either keep your line as written or trim those modifiers, then share the one-breath version you’d actually use.

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s the one I’d actually use:

In Monday’s go/no‑go for Release 12, when you moved items on the shared board, I felt flustered and lost my place, and I updated the deck afterward to clarify.

Does that stay within the four beats cleanly, or should I pare the impact to just “I felt flustered” and leave out “lost my place”? And is “moved items” specific enough for recognition, or does it need “from Ready to In Progress” to pass the camera test? I can try another pass if you think I should tighten it further.

**MentorAI:**

In your org, would “moved items on the shared board” be instantly recognized (i.e., clearly the Ready→In Progress shift), or could it mean a few different edits—if it’s ambiguous, add the lane change; if not, keep it lean; what would you choose, and give me your final one‑breath line?

**elise_SBI:**

Given our org’s habits, “moved items on the shared board” could mean a few different edits, so I’d add the lane change. My final one‑breath line would be:

In Monday’s go/no‑go for Release 12, when you moved items from Ready to In Progress on the shared board, I felt flustered and updated the deck afterward to clarify.

Does that stay true to the four beats without getting wordy? Should I drop “afterward” as implied, or is it helpful to keep? I can try another pass if you think I should tighten it more.

**MentorAI:**

That stays within the four beats—clean. I’d drop “afterward”; the sequence is obvious, and trimming adverbs first keeps it tight: “In Monday’s go/no‑go for Release 12, when you moved items from Ready to In Progress on the shared board, I felt flustered and updated the deck to clarify.” Do a quick breath read; if it’s smooth, lock it in and use that version.

**elise_SBI:**

Breath read feels smooth for me. The longest bit is “from Ready to In Progress on the shared board,” but I can get through it without rushing.

Here’s the version I’d lock:
“In Monday’s go/no‑go for Release 12, when you moved items from Ready to In Progress on the shared board, I felt flustered and updated the deck to clarify.”

I think that works, but I’m not 100% sure I won’t stumble under pressure. Would you suggest adding a light lead‑in like “Can I pause you for a second?” or is that extra in this format? And… would it be helpful to do one more quick one‑breath rep with a different behavior, just to make sure I can apply the same pattern without your coaching? I feel like your four‑beat structure is what made this click.

**MentorAI:**

Makes sense to want a runway—one short lead‑in can steady you without adding weight. When you picture saying this in the room, what exact light lead‑in—e.g., “Can I pause us for a second?”—will you use right before your one‑breath line?

**elise_SBI:**

I’d use: “Can I pause us for a moment?”

Does that land as light and respectful enough with the VP and vendor on, or would you nudge it to “Can we pause for a moment?” to feel more inclusive? I can practice saying it with the one‑breath line if you think this phrasing fits—just want to make sure I’m not over- or under-formal here.

**MentorAI:**

You’re in the polish zone—both work, but I’d nudge to “Can we pause for a moment?” It reads lighter and more inclusive, especially with execs/vendor present; save “Can I…” for small internal loops.

Go ahead and pair that lead‑in with your one‑breath line exactly as you’d say it and send it.

**elise_SBI:**

Can we pause for a moment? In Monday’s go/no‑go for Release 12, when you moved items from Ready to In Progress on the shared board, I felt flustered and updated the deck to clarify.

Does that read as the right tone with execs/vendor, or is “flustered” a bit too revealing—would you nudge me toward “I got thrown off” instead? Also, is the pacing okay as one breath, or should I insert a tiny beat after “shared board”? I can try it once more if you think a small tweak would make it smoother.

**MentorAI:**

You’re tuning tone now—both options are acceptable with execs/vendor. If “flustered” feels a bit exposed in that room, “I got thrown off” or “I lost my place” keeps it owned and professional; add a tiny pause after “shared board,” then deliver the impact—still one breath. Go ahead and pair “Can we pause for a moment?” with the version you’d actually say and send it.

**elise_SBI:**

Can we pause for a moment? In Monday’s go/no‑go for Release 12, when you moved items from Ready to In Progress on the shared board, I lost my place and updated the deck to clarify.

Does that strike the right tone, or would you prefer I use “I got thrown off” there? And was the tiny pause after “shared board” the right spot? I can run it once more if a small tweak would make it smoother.

**MentorAI:**

That lands—“I lost my place” is crisp and professional with execs; “I got thrown off” is a softer equivalent, but you don’t need it. The tiny pause after “shared board” is the right spot; deliver the impact right after and you’re solid.

One look ahead: in your next real meeting, what’s the single cue you’ll watch for that tells you judgment is creeping in, and what exact reset line will you use to get back to SBI?

**elise_SBI:**

Cue I’ll watch for: the instant I hear a label or motive in my head or mouth (e.g., “that felt disrespectful/dismissive” or “you undermined me”) instead of a single observable verb.

Exact reset line I’ll use:
“Can we pause for a moment? Let me put that more concretely: in [specific moment], when you [single observable verb], I [felt X] and [direct consequence I handled].”

Does that count as specific enough, or do you want me to lock one emotion/consequence too (e.g., “…I lost my place and updated the deck”)? I can try saying it once more to make sure the wording is tight if that’s helpful.

**MentorAI:**

Your reset line is specific enough. Under pressure, pre‑commit a default impact pair you’ll reuse—here, “I lost my place and updated the deck”—so you can drop it in without hunting for words. Takeaway: in the moment, hold to one moment, one verb, one owned impact, and lean on your pre‑set impact pair to stay crisp.

**elise_SBI:**

Got it—one moment, one verb, one owned impact, and pre‑commit the impact pair. I’ll default to “I lost my place and updated the deck,” which feels crisp, though I’m a little nervous it might sound repetitive—or a bit self‑critical—in back‑to‑back meetings. Is it okay to lean on that as my standard and only swap it out if the consequence is clearly different, or should I also keep a backup like “I had to follow up afterward to clarify”?

Would it be alright if I do one last 20‑second dry run—lead‑in plus the one‑breath line—just to lock the rhythm? I think your structure is what made this click for me, but I want to make sure I can actually deliver it under pressure.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fair to worry about sounding repetitive—consistency beats vagueness under pressure. Pre‑commit a primary impact pair and one backup; use the default unless the consequence genuinely changes, then swap to the backup (repetition is fine, it reads as disciplined, not self‑critical). When you’re ready, give me your 20‑second lead‑in plus one‑breath line exactly as you’d say it.

**elise_SBI:**

Can we pause for a moment? In Monday’s go/no‑go for Release 12, when you moved items from Ready to In Progress on the shared board, I lost my place and updated the deck to clarify.

Does that cadence feel tight enough, or should I trim to “updated the deck” and leave “to clarify” implied? If it helps, I can do one more quick rep using my backup pair to make sure I can swap cleanly under pressure.

**MentorAI:**

Cadence is tight; “to clarify” is optional—trim purpose phrases first when you want max snap, so “updated the deck” is enough here. If you want to lock the swap, run one quick rep using your backup impact pair now; I’m listening.
