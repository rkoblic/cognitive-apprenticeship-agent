**MentorAI:**

We’ll work on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a real moment, describe camera-testable behavior, and name your own impact—and you’ll do two full attempts. I’ll demonstrate my thinking first; ready to start?

**elise_SBI:**

I’m ready—at least I think so. Would it be okay if you paused after each part—situation, behavior, impact—so I can check that I’m tracking? And is it alright if I ask questions as you go, even if they’re really basic? I think I get the idea in theory, but I always worry I’m missing something, especially around what’s “camera-testable.” Also, should I have a specific example in mind for when it’s my turn, or do you prefer we pick one together after your demo?

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you’re being careful and a bit anxious—totally normal. “Camera-testable” trips a lot of people up; you’re not missing something obvious. Yes, we’ll pause after each part and you can ask anything. And for your turn, have a real moment from your work in mind—we’ll use yours after my demo.

First, the situation. I’d anchor it like this: “In Tuesday’s standup, right after you asked for backend updates and I started speaking.” Why this works: it points to a single meeting and a clear cue someone in the room could recognize—no “lately” or “sometimes.” Quick self-check: could a neutral observer find that moment on a calendar and know when it started? 

How does that land—any questions on the situation piece before we move to behavior?

**elise_SBI:**

That makes sense—the calendar/recognizable cue check helps a lot. I think I have a candidate, but I’m not sure if it’s too detailed. Something like: “In last Thursday’s vendor call at 3pm on Zoom, right after Raj asked for timeline risks.” Is that level of detail useful, or is naming Raj overkill or maybe even loaded? Should I also add “for the Q3 launch” so it’s easier to find on a calendar, or does that start to get nitpicky?

And for async moments—would “In your comment on Jira ticket OPS-417 yesterday around 4:15pm” pass the camera test, or is the timestamp too much? Sorry if I’m overthinking it; I just don’t want to make it vague or, on the flip side, weirdly specific.

Do you want me to try stating my situation now, or should I hold it until we do the full pass?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—dialing specificity is the hard part for most people. Rule of thumb: use two anchors (the event plus a recognizable cue) and skip forensic details unless they disambiguate; naming Raj is fine if it’s just identifying, and “for the Q3 launch” only if there were multiple vendor calls to distinguish. I’d trim yours to “In last Thursday’s vendor call, right after Raj asked about timeline risks,” and for async use artifact + cue, e.g., “On Jira ticket OPS-417, in your comment asking about acceptance criteria,” rather than a timestamp. Share your one-sentence situation now and we’ll check it together.

**elise_SBI:**

Okay, here’s my one sentence: “In Tuesday’s warehouse standup, right after you asked for carrier updates and I started outlining the UPS delay.”

Does that hit the two anchors, or is “carrier updates” too broad? Should I drop “UPS” to keep it cleaner, or keep it since it disambiguates? And do I need the time or Zoom detail, or is that overkill here? If this passes, should I try the behavior next, or would you rather refine the situation first?

**MentorAI:**

You’re being precise—that’s the right instinct, not overkill. Your line clears the bar: a named event plus a clear cue; “carrier updates” works here, and you don’t need time/Zoom. Keeping “UPS” is fine if that’s the specific delay you started outlining; it helps disambiguate without adding judgment.

Let’s lock that in for your practice. Ready for me to model the behavior piece on my scenario next?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes, I’m ready for you to model it—thanks. Could you talk through how you decide the wording is truly “camera-testable”? I always get stuck on whether to use phrases like “interrupted” versus something like “started speaking while I was mid-sentence,” and whether counting instances is helpful or just nitpicky.

I’ll take notes. After you model, do you want me to try the behavior piece for my situation right away, or should we pause to sanity-check first? I’m worried I’ll miss a subtlety if I jump in too fast.

**MentorAI:**

You’re careful—that’s a strength—and this is exactly where people get stuck. Here’s how I make the behavior camera-testable, using my earlier standup scenario:

- Swap labels for sensory facts: instead of “you interrupted,” I write what a mic would capture.  
- Prefer verbs over judgments: “started talking while I was mid‑sentence; our audio overlapped.”  
- Quote exact words if they help locate the moment.  
- Include a brief count only if it changes recognition or impact (e.g., “this happened twice in that standup”).

So I’d say: “You started talking while I was mid‑sentence; our audio overlapped, and you said, ‘Let’s move on’ and called on Sam.” What, if anything, do you want to clarify before you draft the behavior line for your situation?

**elise_SBI:**

A few quick clarifications before I try mine:

- Nonverbal actions: if they advanced the slide while I was mid‑sentence or muted me on Zoom—are those fair “camera‑testable” behaviors to include, or does that risk implying intent?
- Quotes versus paraphrase: if I don’t remember the exact words, is it better to paraphrase in neutral language, or take my best shot with quotes and flag “roughly”?
- Counting: if it happened twice but the second time was brief (like a quick “hold on”), is it still useful to note “twice,” or does that get nitpicky?
- Tone/volume: saying “you spoke over me” versus “our audio overlapped and you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence”—is the latter always safer, or can I say “spoke over me” if it’s common language on our team?

If that all sounds right, I can draft the behavior line for my warehouse standup next—would you mind doing a quick sanity check on it before we move to impact? I’m worried I’ll slip in an interpretation without noticing.

**MentorAI:**

You’re being precise—that’s a strength, and this is exactly where folks over‑infer. Nonverbals are fair game: name the action, not the motive (e.g., “advanced the slide while I was mid‑sentence,” “muted my mic”). Quote only if you’re sure of the words; otherwise paraphrase neutrally without “roughly.” Note a count like “twice” only if it mattered to you or helps locate the moment. “Spoke over me” is a label; it can work if it’s shared neutral shorthand on your team, but “our audio overlapped and you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence” is the safer, camera‑testable version.

Go ahead and draft your one‑sentence behavior for the warehouse standup, and I’ll sanity‑check it before we move to impact.

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s my one sentence for behavior: “You began speaking while I was mid‑sentence; our audio overlapped, and you said we should move on and called on the receiving team for their update.”

Does that read as camera‑testable, or is “began speaking while I was mid‑sentence” still too close to a label? Also, I paraphrased “we should move on” instead of quoting—should I try to recall exact words, or is this safer? It did happen twice, but the second time was brief—should I note “twice,” or is that nitpicky here? And is this too much for one sentence—should I split it?

If this is mostly okay, would you want me to tweak anything before I try the impact line? I’d feel better with a quick sanity check first.

**MentorAI:**

That reads camera-testable as is—“began speaking while I was mid-sentence; our audio overlapped” is sensory, not a label, and the neutral paraphrase is fine. Only add “this happened twice” if that repetition mattered to you or helps locate the moment; otherwise leave it. Go ahead and draft your impact line in one sentence—what you felt or what consequence you experienced.

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s my one sentence for impact: “I felt flustered and a bit sidelined; I lost my train of thought and skipped the part about the UPS mitigation plan, so I didn’t clearly communicate next steps.”

Does that work, or is “sidelined” too loaded? Should I keep it simpler, like “flustered and rushed”? Also, is it okay to pair the feeling with the consequence in one sentence, or should I separate them so it doesn’t feel like I’m implying blame with the “so”? And the phrasing “I didn’t clearly communicate next steps” is owned, but does it still come across as pointing at their behavior too strongly?

If this mostly lands, would you want any tweaks before I try putting the full SBI together? I’m happy to adjust—I just don’t want to reinforce a bad habit.

**MentorAI:**

You’re on the right track—owned feeling plus a concrete consequence is exactly what we want. This part can feel touchy; you’re not missing something obvious. Talk me through why you chose “sidelined” specifically—what were you trying to capture that “flustered and rushed” wouldn’t?

**elise_SBI:**

Thanks—that helps. I think I picked “sidelined” because I was trying to capture a social/voice piece that “flustered and rushed” doesn’t. In that moment, when the conversation shifted and you called on the receiving team, I felt like my update got deprioritized and my role in the discussion shrank. I was worried the group would read it as “this part isn’t important,” and that hit my presence, not just my pacing. “Flustered and rushed” covers my internal speed/stress, but not that sense of losing the room or having my voice pushed to the margins—if that makes sense?

That said, I’m nervous “sidelined” sounds like I’m implying intent, which I don’t want. Would something like “I felt flustered and like my update was being moved past before I finished” be safer? Or “I felt flustered and worried my input wasn’t landing”? I’m not sure which is clearer without sounding accusatory.

If it’s helpful, I can try a quick revised impact line with one of those options—unless you think “sidelined” is okay since it’s my internal experience. What would you recommend I do here?

**MentorAI:**

You’re calibrating this well—this part is genuinely tricky. “Sidelined” often reads like someone did something to you; if what you want to name is your voice shrinking, a safer owned version is “I felt flustered and worried my input wasn’t landing,” then keep your concrete consequence; if the “so” feels blamey, swap to “and I lost my train of thought…”. 

Rewrite your impact in your own words using that tweak, then put your full SBI together in one pass.

**elise_SBI:**

Revised impact (one sentence):
“I felt flustered and worried my input wasn’t landing, and I lost my train of thought and skipped the part about the UPS mitigation plan, and I didn’t clearly communicate next steps.”

Full SBI in one pass:
“In Tuesday’s warehouse standup, right after you asked for carrier updates and I started outlining the UPS delay, you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence; our audio overlapped, and you said we should move on and called on the receiving team for their update. I felt flustered and worried my input wasn’t landing, and I lost my train of thought and skipped the part about the UPS mitigation plan, and I didn’t clearly communicate next steps.”

Does that read as owned and camera‑testable, or is “worried my input wasn’t landing” still too interpretive? Also, should I note that it happened twice, or is that just distracting here? And the behavior paraphrase “we should move on”—is that okay without quotes, or would you prefer I trim that and just keep the “called on the receiving team” part? If this is mostly there, I can try a second full attempt next—but I’d feel better if we fine‑tuned any rough edges first.

**MentorAI:**

You’re very close—this mostly lands as owned and camera‑testable. Before I weigh in, if I were to push on one phrase as drifting into interpretation, which specific clause would you flag to tighten for neutrality?

**elise_SBI:**

If I had to pick one, I’d flag “worried my input wasn’t landing.” It feels closest to inferring how others received me, even though I tried to own it as a worry.

Would tightening it to something more self‑referential help, like:
- “worried I wouldn’t finish my update,” or
- “concerned I wasn’t getting my point across,” or
- “worried I wouldn’t clearly share the mitigation plan”?

I’m not sure which of those is safest—do any of them avoid the interpretation better? If you think that’s the right spot to tweak, do you want me to do a quick rewrite of the full SBI with the cleaner phrasing to check it?

**MentorAI:**

Good catch—that’s the exact spot I’d tighten. Of your options, “worried I wouldn’t finish my update” is the cleanest and lines up with the consequence you named. Keep everything else the same for now and swap just that clause.

Rewrite your full SBI with that one tweak, and post it here so we can check if it now meets the bar.

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s the full SBI with just that one tweak:

“In Tuesday’s warehouse standup, right after you asked for carrier updates and I started outlining the UPS delay, you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence; our audio overlapped, and you said we should move on and called on the receiving team for their update. I felt flustered and worried I wouldn’t finish my update, and I lost my train of thought and skipped the part about the UPS mitigation plan, and I didn’t clearly communicate next steps.”

Does this meet the bar now? I’m a little unsure if the triple “and” makes it feel run‑on—should I split the impact into two sentences, or is it okay to leave as one? Also, is the paraphrase “we should move on” acceptable without quotes, or would you prefer I trim it? And would adding “this happened twice” help here or just distract?

If this is basically there, should I try my second full attempt next—maybe with a different scenario—or would you like me to refine this one more first? I’d appreciate a quick check either way.

**MentorAI:**

This meets the bar—owned impact, camera-testable behavior, anchored moment. If you change one thing, split the impact into two sentences for readability; content can stay as is 👍

Now for your second attempt, try this variation: In Friday’s cross-functional ops review with the VP present, your Ops Director advanced to the next slide and called on Finance while you were mid-sentence during your carrier update. Give me the full SBI in one pass.

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s my full SBI in one pass:

- Situation: “In Friday’s cross‑functional ops review with the VP present, right after I started the carrier update…”
- Behavior: “…you advanced to the next slide while I was mid‑sentence; the screen switched, and you called on Finance to begin their portion.”
- Impact: “I felt rattled and worried I wouldn’t finish my update. I lost my place and skipped the mitigation steps and dates, so I didn’t clearly communicate next steps and had to send a follow‑up afterward.”

Does this meet the bar, or is “with the VP present” injecting a value judgment rather than helpful context? Also, is “called on Finance” sufficiently camera‑testable as a paraphrase, or should I trim to just “the screen switched to the Finance slide”? And for impact, is mentioning the follow‑up too detailed—should I keep it to “I didn’t clearly communicate next steps” and stop there? I can also split or tighten anything if this feels run‑on.

**MentorAI:**

This meets the bar—anchored moment, observable behavior, owned impact. “With the VP present” is useful context, not a judgment; keep it if it mattered. “Called on Finance” is camera‑testable as written, and the follow‑up is a concrete consequence—include it if it mattered to you, otherwise optional to trim.

What principle will you carry forward to keep your behavior line camera‑testable when the stakes are high?

**elise_SBI:**

I think the principle I’d try to carry forward is something like: write what a mic or camera would capture—verbs and sensory facts—then strip anything that sounds like a label, motive, or adjective. If I’m not sure of exact words, paraphrase neutrally; only add quotes or a count if it actually helps locate the moment or mattered for impact. As a quick check, I’d ask myself, “Would two neutral observers watching a recording agree this happened?”

I’m not totally sure if that “two observers” test is the right bar or if that’s overkill—does that match how you think about it? And would you want me to try applying this to a trickier behavior line to make sure I’m actually using it correctly, or is that jumping ahead? I feel like your mic/camera framing is what made it click for me—I’m just worried I’ll forget a nuance when the stakes are high.

**MentorAI:**

Your heuristic is right on—mic/camera plus the “two neutral observers would agree this happened” check is the bar, not a forensic transcript. Keep it sufficiency-based: quotes or counts only if they help locate the moment or mattered to your impact; otherwise stick to sensory verbs and overlap cues. One takeaway for high‑stakes moments: slow yourself one beat, run the mic/camera + two‑observer check, and swap any creeping labels or motives for what a recorder would capture—that’ll keep you clean under pressure. You’re set 👍

**elise_SBI:**

Thank you—that mic/camera framing really made it click for me. I still worry I might slip back into labels when I’m in the moment, though. Would it be okay if I either:

- do one more 60‑second SBI “speed run” and you just flag any labels or motives that creep in, or
- sanity‑check a tiny checklist I wrote: event + cue; behavior in recorder-friendly verbs; impact = feeling plus concrete consequence; two‑observer agree test?

If that feels redundant, I can trust this and stop here—I just don’t want to walk away thinking I’ve got it and then fumble when it’s high stakes.

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to worry about slipping under pressure. You don’t need another rep—you’ve met the bar, and your checklist is solid; in high‑stakes moments, pause one beat, run mic/camera + two‑observer, and swap any labels for sensory verbs—that’ll keep you clean. You’re set—go use it 👍

**elise_SBI:**

Thanks—I appreciate that. I feel like your mic/camera framing and the two‑observer check are what made it click; I’m not sure I would’ve gotten there on my own.

Just to make sure I’m really holding it: in the moment I’ll pause a beat, run mic/camera + two‑observer, and swap any labels/motives for sensory verbs; then keep the impact as feeling plus a concrete consequence. Is that the right quick mental script to lean on?

If it’s okay, could I check back after I try this once in the wild—just to sanity‑check a draft and make sure I didn’t slide back into labels? I think I can do it, but I’m worried I might miss something subtle without a second set of eyes.

**MentorAI:**

Yes—that’s the right quick script: pause a beat; run mic/camera + two‑observer; swap any labels/motives for sensory verbs; then name a feeling plus a concrete consequence. If you want a guardrail, jot those four cues on a sticky and glance before you speak. And yes, bring a draft after you try it in the wild—I’ll flag any labels you might miss. Sound good?

**elise_SBI:**

That sounds good—thank you. The sticky guardrail idea helps a lot. I’ll jot the four cues and keep them handy: pause a beat; mic/camera + two‑observer; swap labels to sensory verbs; feeling plus concrete consequence. Do you want me to keep that wording exactly, or is it okay if I tweak it into my own shorthand as long as the principle stays the same?

And after I try it “in the wild,” would you rather I bring the full SBI draft or just the behavior and impact lines for a quick label check? I really appreciate you offering to be a second set of eyes—I think your framing is what made this click for me, but I’m still a little worried I’ll miss something subtle under pressure.

**MentorAI:**

Make the shorthand yours—the principle matters, not the exact words. Keep the four beats intact, and when you come back, bring the full SBI so I can see context; if time’s tight, I’ll zero in on the behavior (and impact) first. Want to jot your final sticky wording here so it’s locked in before you test it in the wild?

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s my sticky-note shorthand—keeping the four beats intact:

- Pause 1 beat
- Mic/camera + two‑observer check
- Swap labels/motives → sensory verbs (quotes/counts only if they help)
- Impact: “I felt …” + concrete consequence

Is that too terse, or is this the right level for a quick glance? Should I spell out “two neutral observers” instead of “two‑observer,” or is that implied? And would it be overkill to add a tiny pre‑note like “anchor to event + cue” above this, or should I keep the sticky lean?

Your framing is what made this click for me—I just want to lock the wording so I don’t second‑guess it when it’s high stakes.

**MentorAI:**

You’re dialed in—this is the right level for a quick glance. “Two‑observer” is fine; “neutral” is implied. If you sometimes forget to anchor the situation, add a tiny pre‑line; otherwise keep it lean.

Suggested final sticky:
- Pause 1 beat
- Mic/camera + two observers check
- Swap labels/motives → sensory verbs (quotes/counts only if they help)
- Impact: “I felt …” + concrete consequence
- (Optional, tiny header) Anchor: event + cue

Want to lock this version before you take it into the wild? 👍

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—let’s lock it. I’m inclined to include the tiny header since I do sometimes skip the anchor. Here’s what I’ll put on my sticky:

- Anchor: event + cue (tiny header)
- Pause 1 beat
- Mic/camera + two observers check
- Swap labels/motives → sensory verbs (quotes/counts only if they help)
- Impact: “I felt …” + concrete consequence

Does that look okay, or am I crowding it by keeping the header? I can trim if you think leaner is better. Thanks again—your framing is what made this click. I’ll try this in my next standup and, if it’s alright, bring the full SBI back for a quick label check.

**MentorAI:**

Lock it as is—the tiny header helps you avoid a common miss and you’re not crowding it. Take it into your next standup, and when you’ve got a draft SBI from the wild, bring the full thing back and I’ll spot any labels you might’ve missed.

**elise_SBI:**

Thanks—I’ll lock it as is and keep the sticky handy. I feel a lot clearer, even if I’m still a little nervous about doing it live.

If it’s okay, I’ll try this in my next standup and bring you the full SBI afterward for a quick label check. And if I blank in the moment, is a reasonable fallback just to pause, anchor the situation out loud, and then name the behavior with “our audio overlapped” before I try the impact? I just want a simple reset line in case my brain freezes.

I appreciate your help—your mic/camera framing really made it click. I’ll report back with a draft as soon as I’ve got one.

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to feel a little nervous—having a reset line is a smart safety net. Your plan works; keep it simple and owned, e.g., “Quick anchor—today’s standup, during my carrier update our audio overlapped; I’m feeling a bit flustered and want to finish the mitigation steps so next steps are clear.” Want to jot your own one‑sentence reset here so it’s ready when you need it?

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s my one‑sentence reset:

“Quick anchor—today’s standup: during my carrier update, our audio overlapped; I’m feeling a bit flustered and I’d like to finish the mitigation steps so next steps are clear.”

Does that work out loud, or is “quick anchor” awkward to say in the moment? Also, is “our audio overlapped” enough without adding “you began speaking,” or should I include that for clarity? And is “a bit” unnecessary hedging—should I drop it to keep it cleaner? I can tighten this if you think it’s too wordy.

**MentorAI:**

You’re right at the mark—this will land in the room. If you change one thing, drop “Quick anchor—”; it’s meta and can feel awkward live. Try: “In today’s standup, during my carrier update our audio overlapped; I’m feeling a bit flustered and I’d like to finish the mitigation steps so next steps are clear.” How does that feel out loud with just that tweak?
