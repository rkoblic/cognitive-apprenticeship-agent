**MentorAI:**

We’re going to practice delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor it to a specific moment, describe only observable behavior, and name the impact in your own words. I’ll demo the approach first—ready to jump in?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—I think I’m ready. It would definitely help to see it first. Just to make sure I’ve got the basics straight, it’s Situation, then Behavior, then Impact… right? Do you want me to pick a real scenario now so we can use it after your demo, or should I wait? And is it okay if I ask to pause if I’m not tracking something? I just want to make sure I’m following properly.

**MentorAI:**

Yes—S, then B, then I. Totally fine to pause and ask as we go, and hold your real scenario until after the demo.

Quick demo, thinking out loud:
1) Pick a real moment: Tuesday’s standup, right after I started my update.
2) Name only what a camera would catch: you began talking while I was mid-sentence three times (avoid labels like “rude” or “dismissive”).
3) Own the impact: I felt flustered and lost my train of thought; I skipped flagging the API dependency and had to rework it later.
4) Say it cleanly: “In Tuesday’s standup, right after I began my update, you started talking while I was mid-sentence three times. I got flustered and lost my train of thought, and I didn’t flag the API dependency, which created rework for me later.”

Want me to run that once more, or are you ready to try your own?

**elise_SBI:**

I can try—if it’s okay to go step by step and you can stop me if I’m off?

For the situation, maybe: Monday’s cross-functional ops huddle at 9:30am, right when I started walking through the warehouse transition timeline. Is that specific enough, or too much detail? I also have a vendor call from yesterday I could use if that’s better. Which would you prefer?

**MentorAI:**

You’re being careful—that’s good. If Monday’s ops huddle is the one you actually want to address, it’s specific enough; can you write your full SBI in 1–2 sentences on that now?

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s a try:

“In Monday’s cross‑functional ops huddle at 9:30, right as I started walking through the warehouse transition timeline, you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence twice to suggest switching the pick/pack sequence. I felt rushed and lost my place, and I didn’t cover the risk‑mitigation steps for the cutover, which created confusion and a follow‑up thread later.”

Does that hit the mark, or is “began speaking while I was mid‑sentence” too loaded? And is saying “twice” helpful or just nitpicky? I can tighten it if it’s too wordy—should I try another pass?

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, which single phrase here feels least solid to you, and how would you rewrite it to be more camera-test or more owned-impact?

**elise_SBI:**

The phrase that feels least solid to me is “which created confusion.” It sounds a bit blamey and not very owned.

Maybe I could rewrite that to be more owned-impact, like: “so I started a follow-up thread to clarify the risk‑mitigation steps I’d skipped and spent extra time realigning.”

Does that get closer to the owned-impact you’re aiming for? I’m also a little unsure about “began speaking while I was mid‑sentence,” but I can stick with one change unless you think I should tweak that too.

**MentorAI:**

Good catch—“created confusion” does read as a judgment, and your rewrite is owned and concrete 👍

Run a quick check on your full draft using your new impact line: is the moment recognizable, could a camera/mic capture every behavior phrase as written, and does the impact stay in your experience or a direct consequence—what, if anything, still needs tightening?

**elise_SBI:**

Quick check:

- Moment recognizable: I think so—“Monday’s cross‑functional ops huddle at 9:30, right as I started walking through the warehouse transition timeline.” It might be a tad wordy; maybe trimming to “at the 9:30 ops huddle, when I started the warehouse timeline” is cleaner? Or is the extra detail helpful?

- Camera/mic on behavior: “you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence twice” seems recordable. The phrase “to suggest switching the pick/pack sequence” edges into intent—maybe I should stick to what you actually said, like: “you said, ‘let’s switch the pick/pack sequence,’ while I was mid‑sentence, twice.” Would that be more strictly camera/mic?

- Owned impact: “I felt rushed and lost my place” feels owned. “I started a follow‑up thread to clarify the risk‑mitigation steps I’d skipped and spent extra time realigning” is concrete, but “spent extra time” is a little vague. Should I add when/how much (e.g., “later that afternoon,” or “about 30 minutes”) or is that nitpicky?

If it helps, I can try a slightly tightened version with those tweaks—unless you think the original is fine as is?

**MentorAI:**

You’re reading it well. The big win is your behavior tweak—quoting the actual words avoids intent; that’s the one to lock. The situation length and adding a rough time cost are stylistic—trim if it reads cleaner, and if you add time, keep it light (“about 30 minutes later that afternoon”), no need for precision.

Write your tightened 1–2 sentence SBI now using those choices—let’s see the full pass.

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s the tightened pass:

“In the 9:30 ops huddle on Monday, when I started the warehouse timeline, you said, ‘let’s switch the pick/pack sequence,’ while I was mid‑sentence, twice. I felt rushed and lost my place, and I started a follow‑up thread to clarify the risk‑mitigation steps I’d skipped, spending about 30 minutes later that afternoon realigning.”

Does that land the way you’re aiming for? I’m not sure if the placement of “twice” is clunky, and “later that afternoon” might be unnecessary—should I trim either of those or is this okay as is?

**MentorAI:**

This lands and meets the bar. If you want smoother flow, place “twice” either right after the quote or at the end: “…you said, ‘let’s switch the pick/pack sequence’ twice while I was mid‑sentence” or “…while I was mid‑sentence—twice.” Which placement do you prefer—lock one in and we’ll call this first attempt done?

**elise_SBI:**

I think I’d go with placing it at the end—“while I was mid‑sentence—twice”—it reads a little smoother to me… I think? I’m just not sure if the em‑dash feels too dramatic.

Full pass with that choice:
“In the 9:30 ops huddle on Monday, when I started the warehouse timeline, you said, ‘let’s switch the pick/pack sequence’ while I was mid‑sentence—twice. I felt rushed and lost my place, and I started a follow‑up thread to clarify the risk‑mitigation steps I’d skipped, spending about 30 minutes later that afternoon realigning.”

Does that read cleanly to you, or should I move “twice” right after the quote instead? I can also trim the time bit if it clutters. I’m fine to lock this if you think it works—honestly your guidance is what made it come together. Should I mark this first attempt done, or tweak one more thing?

**MentorAI:**

That reads cleanly—lock it; first attempt done. 👍

Second pass, new variation: Yesterday’s executive steering committee on the warehouse transition (VP Ops, Finance, and the 3PL on the call). Recipient is your manager. While you were walking through the risk‑mitigation steps, they cut in to redirect to budget and advanced the slide before you finished. Write your full SBI in 1–2 sentences for that moment.

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s my pass:

“In yesterday’s executive steering committee on the warehouse transition, while I was walking through the risk‑mitigation steps, you said, ‘let’s move to budget,’ and advanced the slide before I finished. I felt rushed and lost my place, I didn’t cover the remaining mitigation items, and I sent a follow‑up summary after the meeting to clarify for the group, which took about 20 minutes.”

Does that meet the camera/owned-impact bar? Is “before I finished” too pointed, or is that okay since it’s observable? I can trim details (like who was on the call or the time note) if it reads cleaner—should I tighten it?

**MentorAI:**

This meets the bar 👍 Behavior is mic/camera clean, and “before I finished” is observable—not too pointed. The extra details (who was on the call, ~20 minutes) are optional; it reads fine as is. What, if anything, felt different or harder about phrasing this for your manager in an exec setting?

**elise_SBI:**

What felt different was the power/visibility piece. Because it was my manager in front of senior folks, I caught myself wanting to soften or blur the behavior—like saying “we moved to budget” instead of “you said, ‘let’s move to budget,’ and advanced the slide.” I also noticed I over‑explained the impact a bit (who was on the call, the ~20 minutes) like I needed to justify that it mattered. And I hesitated on “before I finished”—it’s observable, but I worried it might read as calling them out.

I think without your nudge about quoting the exact words, I’d have defaulted to vaguer language and maybe shifted to passive voice. So this one felt harder mainly because of hierarchy and the public setting; I was more anxious about tone and about not making them look bad, which tempted me to dilute the clarity.

Do you have a preferred way to keep the tone respectful upward without losing the camera-test—like small “tone cushions” that don’t undermine the SBI? And would it be appropriate after the SBI to add a brief request (“Could we finish mitigation before shifting to budget next time?”) or is that jumping ahead? If it helps, I can try a version with a gentle request—if you think that’s useful.

**MentorAI:**

You’re noticing the hierarchy pull—that urge to soften is common, and you handled it well. Takeaway to carry forward: cushion outside, clarity inside. One brief respect cue keeps tone up without diluting the camera-test (“I know you’re managing time in front of the VPs”), keep the SBI literal, then add a single forward-looking request (“Could we finish the mitigation list before shifting to budget next time?”). Does that rule of thumb feel usable?

**elise_SBI:**

I think that rule of thumb feels usable—having one brief respect cue, keeping the SBI literal, then a single forward-looking request. My only worry is that I might over-cushion and start softening the behavior again, or that a respect cue could edge into mind-reading. For example, is “I know you’re managing time in front of the VPs” okay, or is something like “I get we were tight on time” safer?

If it’s helpful, I could try a quick version on the manager example using that structure—just one sentence of cushion, the literal SBI, then “Could we finish the mitigation list before shifting to budget next time?” Would you want me to draft that, or should we talk tone a bit more first? I don’t want to rush and do it wrong.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fair to worry about over‑cushioning—hierarchy nudges everyone that way, and you’re noticing it early. Use shared context, not motives: “We were tight on time” or “Given the execs on the call” is safer than “I know you’re managing time,” which infers intent. Keep the cushion as a separate, short clause (before or after), keep the SBI literal, then one forward‑looking request is appropriate.

Which single cushion line will you adopt so you stay respectful without guessing their motives?

**elise_SBI:**

If I pick one to carry forward, I’d go with: “We were tight on time.”

It’s short, shared context, and doesn’t guess at motives. Does that work, or is it too generic? If you’re okay with it, I can try layering it with the SBI and a simple request on the manager scenario—unless you’d rather I choose “Given the execs on the call” for that specific case.

**MentorAI:**

“We were tight on time” works—shared context, no mind‑reading. If you want it tied to the setting, “Given the execs on the call” is also safe. Keep it as a single, separate clause; then deliver the literal SBI and one forward‑looking request.

When you’re ready, lock that line and we’ll wrap.

**elise_SBI:**

I’ll lock: “We were tight on time.”

It feels clean and motive‑free. If you’re okay with it, I’ll use that as my default cushion and swap to “Given the execs on the call” in exec settings. Does that sound right? Do you want me to try it once with the SBI and a simple request, or should we stop here? I don’t want to overdo it.

**MentorAI:**

Yes—use “We were tight on time” as your default and swap to “Given the execs on the call” in exec settings; that works. Looking back, what single principle will you carry forward to keep respect without diluting the camera-test when stakes or hierarchy are high?

**elise_SBI:**

I think the single principle I’ll carry forward is: cushion outside, clarity inside—one brief shared‑context respect cue (“We were tight on time”), then deliver the camera‑clean SBI, and add one forward‑looking request.

Does that capture it, or is mentioning the request too much for a “single” principle? If you’d prefer it tighter, I can keep it to “one cushion line; keep the SBI literal.”

**MentorAI:**

Keep the principle tight: one cushion line; keep the SBI literal. Treat the request as a useful add‑on when there’s a clear next step. Takeaway: you’re now catching and stripping judgment even when hierarchy tugs you to soften—that’s what keeps your feedback both respectful and clear.

**elise_SBI:**

Got it: one cushion line; keep the SBI literal—and treat the request as an add‑on when there’s a clear next step. I think that framing finally clicked, but honestly I feel like your prompts about quoting exact words and owning impact did most of the heavy lifting—I’m not sure I’d catch it as cleanly without you there.

I’m still a little nervous about over‑cushioning or having “We were tight on time” read like I’m making excuses. Would it make sense to try one more quick run so I can see if I can hold the line without softening? Or would you rather I take this and practice on my own and bring a couple of drafts back for a check? I’m happy to do either—whatever you think would make sure it sticks.

**MentorAI:**

Makes sense to feel nervous—hierarchy does that. You’ve already shown you can keep the SBI literal even under that pull.

Here’s a quick solo routine to prevent over‑cushioning:
1) Draft the SBI with zero cushion—just the moment, the camera/mic behavior (quote if you can), and your owned impact.
2) Run two checks: a) could a camera/mic capture every behavior phrase; b) is the impact your feeling or a direct consequence you experienced.
3) Add one short shared‑context cushion line outside the SBI.
4) If there’s a clear next step, add one request.

Do you want one more rapid rep now using this, or take the routine and bring two drafts back next time?

**elise_SBI:**

If it’s okay, I’d like to do one more rapid rep now to test the routine—maybe just a quick, timeboxed pass?

I can use the vendor call from yesterday as the scenario, unless you’d prefer something else. Would you like me to draft steps 1–2 silently and then share the SBI for a quick skim before I add the cushion and request, or narrate as I go? I’m happy to do it whichever way helps you catch me if I start over‑cushioning.

**MentorAI:**

Totally fine to do a quick rep—wanting to test the muscle is a good instinct. Use the vendor call and draft just the SBI in 1–2 sentences: a specific moment, observable behavior (quote if you can), and your owned impact or direct consequence—no cushion or request yet. Share it when you’re ready.

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s the SBI (no cushion or request):

“In yesterday’s 2pm vendor call with NorthStar Logistics, while I was walking through the data‑validation steps, you said, ‘We can lock the June 15 go‑live,’ and marked ‘Confirmed’ in the shared tracker we had on screen before I finished. I felt pressured and lost the chance to flag two open dependencies, and I scheduled a follow‑up after the meeting to clarify risks and re‑align on timing, which took about 25 minutes.”

Does that meet the camera/owned‑impact bar, or is “felt pressured” too strong? I can trim the on‑screen tracker detail or the time note if that’s cluttering it—should I?

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like you’re watching tone closely—normal when stakes feel higher. This draft meets the bar; “I felt pressured” is owned and fine.

Ready to add your one cushion line and a single forward-looking request using your routine—then share the full?

**elise_SBI:**

We were tight on time. In yesterday’s 2pm vendor call with NorthStar Logistics, while I was walking through the data‑validation steps, you said, “We can lock the June 15 go‑live,” and marked “Confirmed” in the shared tracker before I finished. I felt pressured and lost the chance to flag two open dependencies, and I scheduled a follow‑up after the meeting to clarify risks and re‑align on timing, which took about 25 minutes. Could we hold off on marking dates as confirmed until we’ve finished the dependency review next time?

Does that keep the cushion outside and the SBI literal the way you’re aiming for? If the time note or “before I finished” feels heavy, I can trim. Also, is that request phrased simply enough, or should I tighten it further? I’m happy to adjust.

**MentorAI:**

You’re holding the line—this keeps the cushion outside and the SBI literal; the request is crisp. “Before I finished” is observable, and the tracker detail is fine; the only optional trim is the “about 25 minutes”—use it only if you need to underscore impact. Either way, it meets the bar. Do you want to lock it as is, or drop the time note to keep it tighter?

**elise_SBI:**

I’d lean toward dropping the time note to keep it tighter, unless you think it helps underscore the impact in this context.

Here’s the tightened version:
“We were tight on time. In yesterday’s 2pm vendor call with NorthStar Logistics, while I was walking through the data‑validation steps, you said, ‘We can lock the June 15 go‑live,’ and marked ‘Confirmed’ in the shared tracker before I finished. I felt pressured and lost the chance to flag two open dependencies, and I scheduled a follow‑up after the meeting to clarify risks and re‑align on timing. Could we hold off on marking dates as confirmed until we’ve finished the dependency review next time?”

Does that read cleanly enough to lock, or would you prefer I put the “about 25 minutes” back in to make the impact more tangible? I’m happy to go either way—your guidance has been steering me right here.

**MentorAI:**

Do you want to lock it without the time note and keep the “about 25 minutes” in your back pocket for cases where you need to underscore cost or expect pushback on impact?

**elise_SBI:**

I think I’d like to lock it without the time note—if that sounds right—and keep “about 25 minutes” in my back pocket for cases where I need to underscore cost or expect pushback.

Thanks—your structure made it a lot easier to hold the line. Do you want a final quick read from you just to be sure, or should I take this and practice a couple of drafts with the solo routine for next time?

**MentorAI:**

You’re set—no extra read needed. Take the solo routine and draft two more real SBIs this week (one upward, one peer), then bring them back and we’ll stress‑test them together. Sound good?

**elise_SBI:**

That sounds good—I can draft two real SBIs this week, one upward and one peer. Just to make sure I’m doing it right: do you want me to bring a pure SBI first (no cushion/request) and then layer the single cushion line and a request if there’s a clear next step, or should I write them already in that full form? And still aim for 1–2 sentences, quote exact words where I can, and keep the impact owned—right?

Is it okay if I anonymize names/details? Also, do you want me to send the drafts ahead of our next session, or just bring them in? I’ve jotted your routine so I don’t forget, but I’m a little worried I’ll over‑cushion again—could we do a quick camera/impact check together when we review? Your structure really helped me hold the line; I’m not sure I’d have landed it without that.

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to worry about over‑cushioning—spotting it is the skill. Bring them as pure SBIs first: 1–2 sentences, quote exact words where you can, and keep the impact owned or a direct consequence; we’ll add one cushion line and, if there’s a clear next step, a single request in session. Anonymizing is fine—just keep the moment recognizable. No need to send ahead; bring them and we’ll do the camera/impact check together. Which two real moments will you draft on?
