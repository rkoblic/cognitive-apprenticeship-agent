**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback with the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a specific moment, describe camera-testable behavior, and use owned impact language (and can spot when judgment leaks in). I’ll model first so you can see how I think it through—ready to start?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—ready. Modeling would really help me see how you’re thinking about it. Would you mind pausing briefly between the S, B, and I parts so I can make sure I’m following? And is it okay if I ask quick clarification questions as you go, just to confirm I’m understanding it the way you intend? I don’t want to rush and miss something obvious.

**MentorAI:**

Totally okay to pause and ask quick clarifying questions—you’re not missing something obvious. Let’s start with the moment: I’d anchor it like, “In Tuesday’s standup, right after Priya began her update with the mobile team in the room.” I’m choosing that because a teammate could point to the exact moment—rule of thumb: if someone else can say “I remember that,” it’s specific enough. Does that anchoring make sense before we move to the behavior?

**elise_SBI:**

I think that makes sense—tying it to Tuesday’s standup and the moment Priya started her update feels pinpointed enough that others could recognize it. I’m just wondering, do you ever include things like the exact time or the room name, or is that overkill unless there’s ambiguity? Also, does mentioning who was present (like “with the mobile team in the room”) usually add helpful context, or could that feel like I’m dragging in an audience in a way that might make the person defensive?

If that level is what you consider specific enough, I’m good to move to behavior—unless you think I should practice picking a moment first?

**MentorAI:**

Good questions—totally normal to wonder how much detail to name. My rule: disambiguate, don’t document—add time/room only if there’s a real chance of mix‑ups; name who was present only if it shapes the behavior or your impact, not to “bring an audience” into it.

Sticking with our standup moment, here’s the behavior: you spoke over Priya twice within the first minute of her update, saying “hold on” and “let me jump in,” and continued for about 20 seconds while she was mid‑sentence. I’m avoiding labels like “dismissive,” sticking to counts, brief quotes, and duration—the camera-test. Does that behavior phrasing feel camera-testable to you, or is there anything you’d tweak before we move to impact?

**elise_SBI:**

It mostly sounds camera‑testable to me—the “twice,” the brief quotes, and the “about 20 seconds” all feel very observable. The only phrase I hesitated on was “spoke over,” which I worry might be a little interpretive? Would something like “began speaking while Priya was mid‑sentence” be more strictly observable, or is “spoke over” common enough that it passes the camera test in your view?

Also, is “within the first minute” helpful context here, or does it not add much beyond anchoring us in the moment? And for the duration, does “about 20 seconds” feel specific enough, or should it be “approximately 20 seconds” or even “for several seconds” if I didn’t actually check a clock? I’m probably overthinking the exactness.

If that sounds right to you, should we move to impact, or would you want me to try restating the behavior once in my own words first?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overthinking—this is exactly where the craft lives, and small wording choices matter. “Spoke over” can read interpretive; “began speaking while Priya was mid‑sentence” is the stricter camera-test. “Within the first minute” is optional since we’ve already anchored the moment; keep “about 20 seconds” if duration shaped your experience—“about” is precise enough. Tightened, I’d say: “You began speaking while Priya was mid‑sentence twice, saying ‘hold on’ and ‘let me jump in,’ and continued for about 20 seconds.” If that lands, say the word and I’ll model the impact next.

**elise_SBI:**

That wording mostly lands for me—I like how concrete it is. I might be nitpicking, but does the placement of “twice” matter for clarity? Like, is “twice” best right after “mid‑sentence,” or would it be cleaner after the quotes? I can’t tell if order has any practical impact, or if I’m just fussing.

If you’re good with it as is, I’d love to see how you model the impact. I still get a little tangled between owning my experience and accidentally implying intent, so seeing your version would help. Unless you’d rather I try one first? I can attempt it, but I’d feel better with your model to anchor me.

**MentorAI:**

You’re not fussing—put “twice” close to the action for readability; it’s style, not substance. Impact I’d model here: when that happened, I felt a spike of tension and lost the thread of Priya’s update; I held my question to avoid adding to the cross‑talk and left unsure what the mobile team needed from us. I’m choosing emotion + immediate effect on me/my work, and I’m avoiding any hint of intent or labels—self‑check: if you can swap “I felt…” for “it was…” and it still reads, that’s a judgment to rewrite. Does that impact land for you, or anything you want to clarify before we stitch the full SBI together?

**elise_SBI:**

It mostly lands for me—I like how you paired an emotion with concrete effects on your work. I’m wondering about a couple tiny things:

- “I lost the thread of Priya’s update”—does that risk sounding a bit interpretive, or is “I found it hard to follow her update” safer while still owned? I can’t tell if I’m splitting hairs.
- Including “I held my question” as part of impact—does that fit as “immediate effect on my behavior,” or is that getting too close to describing a new behavior?
- For the emotion, is “a spike of tension” specific enough, or would something like “I felt on edge/embarrassed” be better? I’m never sure how strong to go with emotion labels.
- On your self-check: if I swap “I felt” for “it was,” “it was a spike of tension” doesn’t really parse, which I think is good. But “it was hard to follow Priya’s update” does parse—does that mean I should say “I found it hard to follow” to keep it clearly owned?

If that all sounds fine, would you prefer to model the full SBI once so I can hear the flow, or should I try stitching it together and you sanity-check me? I’m happy to try; I just don’t want to smuggle in any judgment without realizing it.

**MentorAI:**

You’re doing the right kind of precision—these micro word choices are the craft, not fussing. Here’s the full pass with the stricter phrasing we discussed: In Tuesday’s standup, right after Priya began her update with the mobile team in the room, you began speaking while she was mid‑sentence twice, saying “hold on” and “let me jump in,” and continued for about 20 seconds. When that happened, I felt tense and found it hard to follow Priya’s update; I held my question to avoid adding to the cross‑talk and left unsure what the mobile team needed from us. What, if anything, would you change before we shift to your first attempt?

**elise_SBI:**

It reads really tight to me. A couple of small things I wondered about—possibly over-fussing:

- “With the mobile team in the room”: since the impact ends with being unsure what the mobile team needed, I think it earns its place. But is it better to keep it up front for context as you did, or mention that detail in the impact only? I’m not sure which flows cleaner.
- The semicolon before “I held my question”: in spoken delivery, would you break that into two shorter sentences so it breathes? I worry I might ramble if I try to say it as one.
- “Left unsure what the mobile team needed from us”: would “I left unsure…” or “I was unsure…” be a shade clearer and more owned? It’s already pretty owned; I just don’t want it to sound passive.
- Tiny style thing: is “cross‑talk” the right level of jargon, or would “overlap” or “talking over each other” be plainer in conversation?

None of these feel like deal-breakers; your version feels camera-testable and owned. If those tweaks aren’t necessary, I’m happy to leave it as is.

Would you like me to try my first attempt now? If so, could I go step by step (S, then B, then I) with quick check-ins? I’m nervous I’ll sneak in a judgment without noticing if I stitch it all at once.

**MentorAI:**

All those tweaks are stylistic—pick what sounds natural in your voice; none of them break the criteria. You’ve got the shape—let’s move to your first practice. Give me one full draft, all in one go, from a real recent moment with a peer: anchor the specific moment, describe camera‑testable behavior, and name your owned impact. What’s your full SBI?

**elise_SBI:**

Okay—here’s one full pass from a recent moment:

In Monday’s planning meeting, right after I opened the timeline slide, you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence twice, saying “hold on” and “that’s not quite right,” and then took control of the shared screen to scroll to your section for about 25 seconds. When that happened, I felt tense and a bit flustered; I lost my train of thought, skipped the mitigation I’d planned to cover, and left unsure whether the team heard the dependencies we needed to flag.

Is that close to what you’re looking for? I’m not sure if “took control of the shared screen” is the cleanest camera‑test phrasing—should it be “you requested control and started scrolling,” or is that splitting hairs? And is “flustered” too strong; would “I found it hard to finish my point” be safer? Also, I said “about 25 seconds,” but I didn’t time it—would “about 20 seconds” or “for several seconds” be more honest? Happy to rework any part if this doesn’t meet the bar.

**MentorAI:**

This is close and well-anchored—you’re working at the right level of precision. Before I weigh in, predict where I’ll push back: if one part risks slipping from camera-testable into interpretation, or if any part of the impact reads like judgment instead of your experience, which is it and why? Your call—what’s the likeliest weak spot?

**elise_SBI:**

If I had to pick the likeliest weak spot, I think it’s in the impact: “I left unsure whether the team heard the dependencies we needed to flag.” Even though I started with “I,” it might still nudge toward judging what the team did or didn’t take in, instead of keeping the focus squarely on my experience. Maybe something like “I left unsure whether I had clearly communicated the dependencies” or “I wasn’t confident the dependencies were clear to the group” would keep it more owned? I’m not sure if that’s better or if I’m overcorrecting.

A close second might be the behavior wording “took control of the shared screen”—it’s probably fine, but if you push for stricter camera‑test, maybe “you clicked Request Control and started scrolling” is cleaner.

Would you like me to try a quick rewrite with those tweaks, or should I hold and hear your feedback first? I don’t want to jump ahead if that’s not helpful.

**MentorAI:**

You’re spotting exactly the right risks—good instincts. Run two quick checks on your draft: do the “it was…” swap on your impact line and the camera test on the behavior, then tell me what (if anything) you’d change based on those. What do you get?

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s what I get from the two checks:

1) “It was…” swap on impact:
- “I felt tense and a bit flustered” → “It was tense/flustering” shifts to judging the room, so the original reads as clearly owned. That seems okay to me.
- “I lost my train of thought” and “I skipped the mitigation I’d planned to cover” don’t really convert cleanly to “it was…,” which makes me think they’re owned impacts—also seems okay.
- “I left unsure whether the team heard the dependencies we needed to flag” → “It was unclear whether the team heard the dependencies…” still reads, which nudges into a room-level judgment. I’d rewrite to keep it squarely on me, maybe: “I wasn’t confident I’d communicated the dependencies clearly to the group.” Does that keep it owned without implying anything about what the team did or didn’t do?

2) Camera test on behavior:
- “You began speaking while I was mid‑sentence twice, saying ‘hold on’ and ‘that’s not quite right’” feels observable: counts + quotes + timing.
- The only part I’d tighten is “took control of the shared screen.” To be more camera‑testable, maybe: “you requested control of the shared screen and started scrolling to your section for about 25 seconds,” or even simpler, “you started scrolling the shared deck for about 25 seconds.” I didn’t time it exactly, so if “about 25 seconds” feels too precise, I could say “for about 20 seconds” or “for several seconds”—I can’t tell which is more honest without sounding vague.

If that direction sounds right, I can restitch the full SBI with those tweaks. Do you want me to try that now, or would you rather weigh in first so I don’t bake in a bad edit?

**MentorAI:**

You’re zeroing in on the right fixes—your rewrites keep it owned and camera‑testable. The impact shift (“I wasn’t confident I’d communicated the dependencies clearly…”) is solid, and “started scrolling the shared deck” reads cleaner than “took control.” For duration, “about 20 seconds” is precise enough if it matches your memory; “several seconds” is safer but blunter—pick what you can stand behind. Give me your full stitched SBI with those tweaks, all in one go.

**elise_SBI:**

In Monday’s planning meeting, right after I opened the timeline slide, you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence twice, saying “hold on” and “that’s not quite right,” and started scrolling the shared deck for about 20 seconds. When that happened, I felt tense and a bit flustered; I lost my train of thought, skipped the mitigation I’d planned to cover, and I wasn’t confident I’d communicated the dependencies clearly to the group.

Does that meet the bar for you? I’m not sure if “a bit flustered” is too casual and I should say “I found it hard to finish my point” instead, and I picked “about 20 seconds” based on memory—should that be “several seconds” to be safer? Also, is “started scrolling the shared deck” camera‑testable enough, or would you want me to specify “you requested control and scrolled” for clarity? I can adjust any part—just tell me where you’d push.

**MentorAI:**

This meets the bar—clear moment, camera‑test behavior, and owned impact. Before we move to the next rep, why that anchor—what made you choose “right after I opened the timeline slide” as the moment?

**elise_SBI:**

I picked “right after I opened the timeline slide” because it felt like a concrete, recognizable inflection point—everyone can recall the slide change—and the behavior started immediately after that, so it disambiguates the exact moment without piling on extra details. It also ties to the impact since the timeline/dependencies were what I lost the thread on.

That said, I’m not sure if anchoring on something I did (“I opened the slide”) makes it feel a bit self‑centric or like I’m implying cause. Would it be cleaner to say “as we moved into the timeline section” or “at the start of the timeline discussion” so it’s a touch more neutral? Also, does “right after” feel precise enough, or is that too soft and I should be more specific?

If my original anchor works by your standard of disambiguate‑don’t document, I’m happy to keep it. But if you think a more neutral phrasing would land better, I can switch before the next rep. Should I tweak it now, or is it okay as is?

**MentorAI:**

Your original anchor works—naming something you did doesn’t imply cause as long as you stay out of intent; “right after” is precise enough, and “as we moved into the timeline section” is an equally clean alternative if it sounds more natural in your voice. Which phrasing do you want to stick with before we move on?

**elise_SBI:**

I think I’d stick with “as we moved into the timeline section”—it feels a touch more natural in my voice. I’m a little worried it’s a hair less pinpointed than “right after I opened the timeline slide,” since the slide change is such a clear visual anchor. Do you think my version still passes your “someone else could say ‘I remember that’” test, or should I keep the slide language for precision?

If “as we moved into the timeline section” works for you, I’m okay locking that in—should we move on to the next rep?

**MentorAI:**

“As we moved into the timeline section” passes the “I remember that” test—let’s keep it. Second rep, new variation: different peer and higher stakes. In Thursday’s quarterly business review (hybrid, with VP Eng and Sales present), right as you pulled up the risk register, a peer from the Data team (Jordan) cut in mid‑sentence and took over the shared screen to show their filter while you were presenting. Give me your full SBI to Jordan, all in one go.

**elise_SBI:**

In Thursday’s quarterly business review (hybrid), right as I pulled up the risk register with the VP of Engineering and VP of Sales present, you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence, said “hang on—let me show the filter,” switched the shared screen to your laptop, and walked through your filter for about 30 seconds. When that happened, I felt a spike of anxiety and got thrown off; I lost my train of thought, skipped the rationale for two red risks, and I wasn’t confident I’d communicated the prioritization clearly to leadership.

Does that meet the bar? I’m not sure if “said ‘hang on—let me show the filter’” is close enough to an exact quote (I think that’s what you said), or if I should avoid quotes unless I’m certain. Also, is “switched the shared screen” camera‑testable enough, or would “you requested control and changed the share” be clearer? And I guessed “about 30 seconds”—should I soften that to “about 20 seconds” or “for several seconds” if I didn’t time it precisely? Happy to tighten any part you’d push on.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar—specific moment, camera‑test behavior, and owned impact. One small tighten: if you’re not confident that quote is exact, drop the quotation marks and keep it as “you cut in to show the filter”; the rest can stand as written. What will you carry forward from doing this second rep under higher stakes?

**elise_SBI:**

A few things I think I’d carry forward—though I’m not totally sure I’m prioritizing the right ones:

- Anchor: pick a moment others can literally point to (slide change, section start)—disambiguate, don’t document. I sometimes over‑name details, so having that rule helps, especially when senior folks are in the room.
- Behavior: keep it camera‑testable with counts, short quotes, and duration; if I’m not certain on an exact quote, paraphrase without quotation marks. I’ll aim for “began speaking while I was mid‑sentence” over interpretive verbs—but I’m still unsure when something like “cut in” is acceptable shorthand versus too interpretive.
- Style nits that matter: put “twice” near the action; pick “about 20/30 seconds” only if I can stand behind it—otherwise “several seconds,” even if it feels blunter.
- Impact in high‑stakes settings: pair a simple emotion label with immediate effects on my delivery and a concrete consequence for the work (“I skipped X,” “I wasn’t confident I’d communicated Y”), and keep intent out. The “it was…” swap is a helpful check—I’ll use it, though I worry I’ll miss a subtle leak under pressure.
- Audience context: name who’s present only when it shapes the behavior or my impact—not to “bring an audience” into it. With VP Eng/Sales there, it did shape how it landed for me.

That’s what stood out, but I can’t tell if I’m over‑fitting to these specific scenarios. I think your modeling made it feel straightforward; I’m not sure I’d be as clean on my own in the moment.

Would you like me to try a third rep to see if I can apply this without as much scaffolding? If so, do you want it all in one go again, or would you rather I pause after each part for a quick check? I’m okay to attempt either, I just don’t want to drift into judgment without noticing.

**MentorAI:**

You hit the bar on both reps—nice work. Totally normal to worry about drifting under pressure. One thing to carry forward: a 10‑second pre‑flight—Moment • Camera • Mine. Moment: anchor to a recognizable beat; Camera: describe what a camera would catch (counts/brief words/duration, skip shorthand like “cut in” if it could read interpretive); Mine: one emotion + immediate effect on your work, then do the “it was…” swap before you speak. Does that quick check fit your style to use in the moment? 👍

**elise_SBI:**

I think it could fit my style, yes—having a three‑beat check I can run silently feels doable. And thank you for saying the reps hit the bar, though it honestly felt like your modeling made it straightforward; I’m not sure I’d keep it this tidy without that scaffold.

A couple tiny questions so I don’t misuse it:
- For Camera, if I don’t have an exact count, is “a few times” acceptable, or is it better to skip the count and rely on a brief phrase/duration I can stand behind?
- For Mine, is a physical cue okay as the emotion (e.g., “I felt my chest tighten”) or do you prefer a simple label like “anxious”? I worry about sounding too dramatic.
- On the “it was…” swap, do you literally do that in your head right before speaking, or do you ever say a version aloud to buy a second?

If you think I’m ready, could we try a quick 10‑second pre‑flight drill on a fresh scenario and then I’ll deliver one full SBI? I’m happy to try, but I’d feel better if you timed me or gave a quick thumbs‑up/down after.

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to want a beat here—you’re not overdoing it. Quick rules I use: if you can’t stand behind a count, skip “a few times” and lean on brief words/duration you’re confident in; physical cues are fine as the emotion if they’re yours—pair with a simple label if that steadies the tone; do the “it was…” swap silently, and if you need a second, take a breath or say “let me put this clearly” before you speak. Of those micro‑rules, which one will matter most for you under pressure?

**elise_SBI:**

I think the one that’ll matter most for me in the heat of the moment is skipping shaky counts and leaning on brief words/duration I can stand behind. Under pressure I tend to blurt “a few times,” which feels vague and a little slippery, and this rule gives me something concrete to grab.

A very close second is doing the “it was…” swap silently—just to catch any hint that I’m drifting into room‑level judgment instead of staying with my experience. I can also pair a light physical cue with a simple label if that helps steady my tone, though I’m not sure if that’ll sound natural coming out of my mouth.

Does that emphasis make sense for me, or am I overlooking a more important guardrail? If you’re up for it, could we try a quick 10‑second pre‑flight on a fresh scenario and then I’ll deliver one full SBI? I’m happy to attempt it—maybe you can give me a quick thumbs‑up/down after so I know if I’m on track.

**MentorAI:**

That emphasis makes sense—skipping shaky counts and doing the silent “it was…” swap are the right guardrails under pressure. New scenario to run your 10‑second pre‑flight, then give one full SBI: In Monday’s cross‑functional incident review (hybrid, with the CTO and a customer success lead present), as you started the timeline section, your peer from SRE (Sam) began talking while you were mid‑sentence and edited the shared doc—deleting a bullet you were referencing—and continued for roughly 20 seconds. Give me your three quick beats out loud (Moment • Camera • Mine), then your full SBI in one go—I’ll give you a quick thumbs‑up/down after.

**elise_SBI:**

My 10‑second pre‑flight:
- Moment: In Monday’s cross‑functional incident review (hybrid), as we moved into the timeline section, with the CTO and a customer success lead present.
- Camera: You began speaking while I was mid‑sentence and deleted the bullet I was referencing in the shared doc, continuing for about 20 seconds.
- Mine: I felt anxious and got thrown off; I lost my place and wasn’t confident I’d communicated the sequence clearly.

Full SBI:
In Monday’s cross‑functional incident review (hybrid), as we moved into the timeline section with the CTO and a customer success lead present, you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence and deleted the bullet I was referencing in the shared doc, continuing for about 20 seconds. When that happened, I felt anxious and got thrown off; I lost my place, skipped explaining the handoffs for two steps, and I wasn’t confident I’d communicated the sequence clearly to the group.

Does that track for your thumbs check? If “deleted the bullet I was referencing” isn’t strictly camera‑testable enough, I could say “you removed the bullet I was pointing to” or “you backspaced the line I was on”—I’m not sure which reads cleaner.

**MentorAI:**

👍 Thumbs‑up—this tracks. One tiny tighten: swap “deleted the bullet I was referencing” for “removed the bullet I was pointing to” so it’s purely camera‑testable; keep “about 20 seconds” if that matches your memory. Lock that tweak and read it once out loud so it’s in your mouth.

**elise_SBI:**

In Monday’s cross-functional incident review (hybrid), as we moved into the timeline section with the CTO and a customer success lead present, you began speaking while I was mid-sentence and removed the bullet I was pointing to in the shared doc, continuing for about 20 seconds. When that happened, I felt anxious and got thrown off; I lost my place, skipped explaining the handoffs for two steps, and I wasn’t confident I’d communicated the sequence clearly to the group.

Does that sound right in your ear? I was using my cursor to highlight rather than literally pointing—should I say “the bullet I was highlighting” to be more precise, or is “pointing to” fine shorthand? Also, is the cadence okay, or should I break the impact into two sentences? I can read it once more if that helps lock it in.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds right in my ear. If you were using your cursor, “highlighting” is the most precise; “pointing to” is fine shorthand if it’s what you’d naturally say. For delivery, it’s cleaner to split the impact into two sentences when speaking: short beats help you breathe and keep the tone steady. Make that swap if you want, read it once out loud, and tell me if anything still feels sticky.

**elise_SBI:**

Here it is out loud with the tweaks:

In Monday’s cross-functional incident review (hybrid), as we moved into the timeline section with the CTO and a customer success lead present, you began speaking while I was mid-sentence and removed the bullet I was highlighting in the shared doc, continuing for about 20 seconds. When that happened, I felt anxious and got thrown off. I lost my place, skipped explaining the handoffs for two steps, and I wasn’t confident I’d communicated the sequence clearly to the group.

Does that land for you? I’m wondering if “got thrown off” is a bit too casual—would “I found it hard to continue” be better? Also, is “two steps” specific enough, or should I name the actual handoffs to make it crisper? And on flow, is “continued for about 20 seconds” cleaner than “continuing for about 20 seconds,” or am I splitting hairs?

I can read it once more with any of those tweaks if you think it would sharpen it—I’m not sure I’ve fully got it “in my mouth” yet without your guardrails.

**MentorAI:**

This already lands; you’re fine‑tuning tone. If you want it a touch crisper, swap “got thrown off” for “I found it hard to continue”—still owned, a bit steadier. Read it once with that swap—does anything still snag for you?

**elise_SBI:**

Here it is with that swap:

In Monday’s cross-functional incident review (hybrid), as we moved into the timeline section with the CTO and a customer success lead present, you began speaking while I was mid-sentence and removed the bullet I was highlighting in the shared doc, continuing for about 20 seconds. When that happened, I felt anxious and I found it hard to continue. I lost my place, skipped explaining the handoffs for two steps, and I wasn’t confident I’d communicated the sequence clearly to the group.

Does that flow feel right to you? I’m wondering if “continuing” should be “continued” for cleaner delivery, and whether “two steps” is too vague—should I name the actual handoffs? Also, “about 20 seconds” is from memory—does that still pass your bar? I can read it once more with any tweaks if that would help me lock it in.

**MentorAI:**

This flows. For delivery, “continued” will land cleaner than “continuing.” “Two steps” is fine; only name the specific handoffs if it helps the listener recall the exact moments. “About 20 seconds” is acceptable from memory—your “about” hedge is enough; only downgrade to “several seconds” if you truly can’t estimate. Lock those choices and you’re set.
