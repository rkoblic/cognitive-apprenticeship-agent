**MentorAI:**

We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means anchoring to a specific moment, describing observable behavior, and naming your own impact in owned language—plus noticing where judgment sneaks in. I’ll demonstrate first; ready to see the model?

**elise_SBI:**

Yes—seeing the model would be really helpful. Quick check before you start, if that’s okay: when you say “owned language,” is that like using “I felt…” instead of “you made me feel…”? I think that’s right, but I might be mixing things up. If it’s easier, we can just jump in and I’ll follow along, and maybe you can pause me if I’m misunderstanding something?

**MentorAI:**

You’ve got it—owned language is “I felt…” rather than “You made me feel…,” because you’re naming your reaction, not assigning intent. Quick model: anchor to a real moment—Tuesday’s standup when I was outlining the API dependency; name camera-testable behavior—you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice (not “dismissive”); own the impact—I felt rushed, lost my train of thought, and skipped a key detail so I had to DM folks after. Put together: “In Tuesday’s standup, while I was outlining the API dependency, you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice. I felt rushed and lost my train of thought and skipped a key detail, so I had to follow up after.” How’s that land—anything you want me to replay before we move on?

**elise_SBI:**

That landed really clearly—I think. The “camera-testable” bit especially helped. I do have a couple tiny questions just to make sure I’m not glossing over nuance:

- Could you replay the behavior line once more and maybe contrast it with a more judgment-y version? “You started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice” sounds clean, but I’m worried I’d accidentally say something like “you were being dismissive,” and not catch it.

- Also, the “so I had to follow up after” part—is that still considered impact, or is that more of a consequence/process outcome? I can’t tell where that belongs.

If those are quick to clarify, I could try one next—would it be okay if we paused after each part so you can tell me if I’m drifting into judgment before I go on? I just don’t want to bake in a mistake.

**MentorAI:**

You’re reading this right. Quick contrast on the behavior line: “You started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice” is camera-testable; “You were being dismissive” (or “you don’t respect me”) is a judgment about intent. Rule of thumb: if a neutral observer couldn’t verify the words you wrote, or you needed to guess motive, rewrite it as an action.

On impact: “so I had to follow up after” counts—it’s a direct consequence you experienced. You can pair state and consequence: “I felt rushed and had to DM folks after.”

About pacing: let’s do full SBI in one go rather than pausing part-by-part; then we’ll run a self-check together. Ready to try your own on a real moment? Put all three pieces in one draft.

**elise_SBI:**

Okay, I’ll try a full draft. I’m not totally sure this is the best example, but here goes:

“In yesterday’s sprint planning at 11am in the main conference room, while I was outlining the Q3 release timeline, after Sam asked me by name to confirm the cutover date, you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice and answered before I could respond. I felt rushed and a bit sidelined, lost my train of thought, and skipped the QA‑freeze risk, so I had to follow up in Slack afterward to clarify.”

Is that roughly in the ballpark? I’m worried I might have overstuffed the behavior line—does “answered before I could respond” duplicate “started talking while I was mid‑sentence”? And is “sidelined” okay as an “I felt” word, or does that sound like I’m sneaking in a judgment? I can trim or rewrite—should we do a quick self-check together?

**MentorAI:**

This is in the ballpark. Before I weigh in, what’s the one phrase you’d change first—and why?

**elise_SBI:**

If I had to pick one to change first, I think I’d remove “and answered before I could respond.” It feels redundant with “you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice,” and maybe it nudges toward implying intent or control on your part. Keeping just the camera‑testable bit seems cleaner.

So the behavior line would be: “you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice.”

Does that seem like the right thing to tighten first? I’m also a little uneasy about “I felt… sidelined,” but maybe that’s okay since it’s an “I felt” word. Should I leave that for now or swap it for something more neutral?

**MentorAI:**

Good call—that tighten keeps the behavior clean and camera‑testable. On “sidelined”: if you strip away the story and name the raw internal state you felt in that moment (emotion or body sensation), what single word fits for you?

**elise_SBI:**

Stripping it down to the raw state, the first word that fits for me is “flustered.” It maps to losing my train of thought. But I’m not sure if “flustered” sounds a bit minimizing? Would “frustrated” or even a body sensation like “tense” be better? If “flustered” works, I can swap that in—does that seem right?

**MentorAI:**

Read your impact line with each option—flustered, frustrated, tense—and notice which one most accurately matches what you felt in that moment (tie it to what changed in your body or thinking), then use that single word. Pick it and share the updated draft.

**elise_SBI:**

Reading it back with each option, “flustered” matched the actual moment best—I noticed my breath get a little shallow and I lost my train of thought right then. “Frustrated” came later, and “tense” fits my shoulders but not the thinking slip.

Here’s the updated draft:
“In yesterday’s sprint planning at 11am in the main conference room, while I was outlining the Q3 release timeline (after Sam asked me to confirm the cutover date), you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice. I felt flustered, lost my train of thought, and skipped the QA‑freeze risk, so I had to follow up in Slack afterward to clarify.”

Does that read cleanly? I’m second‑guessing a few things:
- Is mentioning Sam in the situation helpful context or just extra noise?
- Is “twice” useful or does it make it sound accusatory?
- And is my impact line too packed—should I separate “flustered” from the consequence?

I can tweak any of those—would it be okay if we do a quick self‑check together before I rewrite? I’m not sure I’m spotting the right issues on my own.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds like good second‑guessing—not overthinking, just tightening. Run this quick self‑check on your draft: 1) moment specific enough to picture without extra context, 2) behavior camera‑testable and motive‑free, 3) impact owned (felt state and/or direct consequence), with no judgment leaking into the behavior line. Where does it pass, where does it wobble, and what one tweak will you make next?

**elise_SBI:**

Okay, quick self-check against your three prompts:

1) Moment specific enough to picture: Mostly passes. “Yesterday’s sprint planning at 11am in the main conference room” paints the scene. The Sam parenthetical feels like extra context I don’t strictly need, so that’s a wobble.

2) Behavior camera-testable, motive-free: Pass. “You started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice” is observable. I’m still a bit nervous that “twice” could read as a bit pointed, but it is verifiable—so I think it’s okay? Not sure if it adds value or just heat.

3) Impact owned (felt state and/or consequence): Pass. “I felt flustered” is owned, and the follow-up/Slack is a direct consequence. Tiny worry it’s a bit packed, but it’s still my experience.

One tweak I’d make next: remove the Sam parenthetical to tighten the situation.

Updated draft (single change):
“In yesterday’s sprint planning at 11am in the main conference room, while I was outlining the Q3 release timeline, you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice. I felt flustered, lost my train of thought, and skipped the QA‑freeze risk, so I had to follow up in Slack afterward to clarify.”

Does that feel like the right edit to prioritize? If so, should I next consider simplifying the impact into two sentences, or is it better to keep it as one and leave “twice” in?

**MentorAI:**

That edit was the right call, and your draft meets the bar as-is. On “twice”: it adds useful specificity without implying motive—keep it if it’s accurate. Let’s test transfer—new variation: in a client kickoff on Zoom, while you were outlining the integration timeline, your manager spoke over you twice and answered the client’s question before you finished. Write the full feedback you’d give your manager using SBI.

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s a first pass:

“In today’s client kickoff on Zoom, while I was outlining the integration timeline, you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice and answered the client’s question before I finished. I felt flustered and rushed, lost my train of thought, and I skipped the data‑migration caveat, so I had to follow up after the call to clarify.”

Does that track? I wasn’t sure whether to use “spoke over me” (which you said) versus “started talking while I was mid‑sentence”—is one cleaner/less loaded? And is it too much to include both behaviors in one line (spoke during my sentence and answered before I finished)? Also, “flustered and rushed” might be redundant—should I pick just one?

If it’s okay, could we run the quick self‑check on this before I tweak anything? I think your model made this a lot easier, but I’m not confident I’d catch subtle judgment if it snuck in.

**MentorAI:**

This tracks and meets the bar—specific moment, camera‑testable behavior, owned impact, no judgment leakage. One tightening: choose the more neutral “you started talking while I was mid‑sentence” and drop “answered the client’s question before I finished” as redundant; keeping “twice” is fine if it’s accurate. What principle will you carry forward from this when you give feedback next time?

**elise_SBI:**

The principle I’m planning to carry forward is: if a neutral observer couldn’t verify the words I’m about to say without guessing motive, I’ll rewrite it as an action. Then I’ll pair it with a single owned state or direct consequence.

I think that captures what clicked for me—but I’m not totally sure if that’s the most important anchor. Does that sound like the right takeaway, or would you frame it differently? If it helps, I could try one more quick example to make sure I’m actually applying it and not just repeating the phrasing from your model.

**MentorAI:**

That’s the right anchor. Keep using the camera test to strip motive, then name the smallest true impact—one felt state or one direct consequence—and stop there 👍

**elise_SBI:**

That helps a lot—camera test to strip motive, then name the smallest true impact and stop. I think I can try that, but I’m a little worried I only got it because your examples were really clear.

Would it be okay if I do one more quick rep to make sure it’s actually sticking? I can do it in one go and then we run the self-check. I have a real moment in mind—Monday’s design review on Zoom where, while I was answering a question, my peer advanced the deck twice and I lost my spot. Does that work as a practice scenario, or would you prefer to give me a different one so I’m not picking an “easy” case? If it’s okay, I’ll draft it and you can just watch for any motive leakage.

**MentorAI:**

That moment works—solid, not “easy,” and great for testing stickiness. Go ahead and write the full feedback for that Zoom design review in one go; we’ll run the self-check after. Your turn.

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s my draft:

“In Monday’s design review on Zoom, while I was answering a question, you advanced the deck twice while I was mid‑answer. I felt flustered.”

Does that read cleanly? I’m second‑guessing whether I duplicated myself with “while I was answering a question” and “mid‑answer,” and if “twice” adds useful specificity or comes off a bit sharp. Can we run the quick self‑check before I tweak it?

**MentorAI:**

This reads cleanly—your second‑guessing here is polishing, not patching. Run the three‑part self‑check we used earlier and name the one edit you’ll make, if any.

**elise_SBI:**

Quick self-check:
1) Moment specific enough to picture: Pass—“Monday’s design review on Zoom” is clear.
2) Behavior camera-testable, motive-free: Pass—“you advanced the deck twice while I was mid‑answer” is observable. Tiny wobble: “twice” feels a bit pointed to me, but it is accurate.
3) Impact owned: Pass—“I felt flustered” is a single felt state, owned.

One edit I’d make: remove the redundancy and keep just one reference to me speaking.

Updated draft (single change):
“In Monday’s design review on Zoom, while I was answering a question, you advanced the deck twice. I felt flustered.”

Does that read tighter to you, or did dropping “mid‑answer” lose any useful precision? I can revert if that was doing important work.

**MentorAI:**

Reads tighter—dropping “mid‑answer” didn’t cost you any precision, and “twice” adds verifiable specificity without heat. If you’re good with this version, want to lock it in?

**elise_SBI:**

I think I’m okay locking this version, unless you see something subtle I’m missing. With your okay, I’ll go with:

“In Monday’s design review on Zoom, while I was answering a question, you advanced the deck twice. I felt flustered.”

I feel like I got there mostly because your “camera test + smallest true impact” reminder kept me on track. Should we lock this and maybe do one more quick rep to make sure it wasn’t just a straightforward example?

**MentorAI:**

Makes sense to want another rep—that urge is a good sign, and you’ve met the bar here. Let’s lock this one and close strong. What’s your early warning sign that you’re starting to drift into judgment when drafting SBI?

**elise_SBI:**

The first early warning sign I notice—at least I think this counts—is when my language starts guessing motive. Words like “dismissive,” “didn’t respect,” or “trying to take over” creep in. I can’t imagine a camera capturing those.

A few other tells that make me worry I’m drifting:
- I reach for absolutes or character labels: “always,” “never,” “rude,” “unprofessional.”
- My behavior line grows long and starts explaining “why” they did it instead of just “what” I saw.
- My impact wording shifts toward blame: “You made me feel…” instead of “I felt…”
- Internally, I feel a little surge of righteousness and start building a case—if I’m trying to prove a point, I’m usually not camera‑testable anymore.

When I spot any of those, my reset (I think) is: run the camera test and rewrite as an action, then name the smallest true impact in one word or one consequence.

Does that sound like the right set of early warnings? I’m not sure if I’m missing a big one. If it helps, we could try a quick spot‑the‑judgment line and see if I catch it?

**MentorAI:**

You’ve got the right early warnings—those are the big ones. One more to watch for: time-aggregators like “often,” “lately,” or “sometimes”—they’re a cue you’ve drifted off a single moment. Takeaway to lock in: keep it to one concrete moment, run the camera test, name the smallest true impact, and if vague time words sneak in, zoom back to one instance and rewrite.

**elise_SBI:**

Got it—thank you. So my lock‑in phrasing (tell me if I’m missing something) is: one concrete moment, run the camera test to strip motive, name the smallest true impact (one feeling or one consequence), and if words like “often/lately/sometimes” slip in, zoom back to a single instance and rewrite as an action. I think that’s right, but I’m a little worried I’ll default to the time‑words when I’m in the moment.

Would it be okay if I keep a tiny cheat‑sheet prompt like: “In [one moment], when you [camera‑testable action], I felt [single word]/so I [single consequence]”? Your framing is what made this click—I’m not sure I’d have gotten there without it.

Do you want me to try a super quick line where I catch an “often” and zoom it to one instance, or is it better to stop here and I’ll practice on my next real meeting and report back?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—keep that cheat‑sheet; it matches the anchor we landed on. If “often/lately” slips in, zoom to one recent instance and rewrite as a camera‑testable action. You’ve hit the bar with two clean reps, so let’s cap it here and call this locked. Deal?

**elise_SBI:**

Deal—I’ll call it locked with the cheat‑sheet in front of me. I’m still a little nervous about doing it cold in the moment, but your “camera test + smallest true impact” framing is what made it click for me, so I think I can lean on that.

Would it be okay if, after my next meeting, I draft the SBI I plan to use and send it for a quick spot‑check? Just to make sure I don’t slip “lately/often” back in without noticing. If that’s overkill, I can just try it and report back—but a quick sanity check would help me feel more confident I’m not drifting into motive again.

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to feel nervous doing this live—it settles with a couple reps. Yes, send your draft after the meeting and I’ll do a quick camera‑test spot‑check. One small handhold in the moment: jot only the behavior as a camera‑testable verb phrase first; add the single moment and smallest true impact after—keeps motive from sneaking in. What turnaround would be most helpful for that spot‑check?

**elise_SBI:**

Ideal would be a quick read within 1–2 hours after I send it, so I can deliver the feedback while it’s still fresh. If that’s too tight, a by–end‑of‑day or next‑morning spot‑check would still help a lot.

Does that timing work for you? I can keep my draft super short—just the camera‑testable behavior plus the single moment and smallest true impact—to make it easy to skim. If you have a preferred window or channel, I’m happy to follow that.

**MentorAI:**

1–2 hours works; if I miss that window, I’ll hit it by EOD or next morning. Send via Slack DM, keep it to one or two sentences (single moment + camera‑testable behavior + smallest true impact), and I’ll reply with a quick “clean” or “tighten” plus one nudge max. Does Slack DM with that timing work for you?

**elise_SBI:**

Slack DM with a 1–2 hour turnaround works for me. If I don’t hear back in that window, I’ll look for your note by EOD or next morning—does that sound right?

I’ll keep it to one or two sentences: single moment + camera‑testable behavior + smallest true impact. Do you want me to tag it with something like “SBI check” at the top to make it easy to spot, or is that overkill? And just to confirm, including specifics like “twice” (if accurate) is okay in that one-liner, right?

I can send the first one after my client sync tomorrow. I’m a little nervous doing it live, but your “camera test + smallest true impact” handhold gives me something solid to lean on.

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to feel nerves—you’ve got a solid handhold. Use “SBI check” at the top and DM one line: “In [one moment], when you [camera‑testable action] (twice if accurate), I felt [single word]/so I [single consequence].” I’ll aim to reply within 1–2 hours; if I miss it, expect EOD or next morning. Anything else you want to run once before the client sync?

**elise_SBI:**

Maybe two super‑quick things, if that’s okay:

1) Opener to ask permission. Would something like either of these be clean, or am I overdoing it?
- “Do you have 60 seconds for a quick observation from the kickoff?”
- “Can I share one thing I noticed on the call?”

2) In a client context, should I lean consequence over feeling, or is a simple “I felt…” still okay with a manager? For example:
- Feeling: “In today’s kickoff, when you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice, I felt flustered.”
- Consequence: “In today’s kickoff, when you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice, I lost my place and missed the data‑migration caveat, so I had to follow up after.”

If that’s too much, I can just pick one and go. And if it’s helpful, I can do a one‑line rehearsal with whichever you recommend—would that be okay?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overdoing it—you’re being precise. For client‑facing moments, lead with the concrete consequence over a feeling; with a manager, either works, but defaulting to the consequence tends to land faster and cleaner. Try a one‑line rehearsal using the consequence version for that kickoff case; I’ll sanity‑check it.

**elise_SBI:**

Here’s a one‑line rehearsal with the consequence:

“In today’s client kickoff on Zoom, when you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice, I lost my place and missed the data‑migration caveat, so I had to follow up after the call.”

Does that land cleanly? Should I drop “on Zoom” for brevity, or keep it? And is “twice” helpful here or a bit sharp? Also, is “started talking while I was mid‑sentence” the better neutral phrasing, or would you swap it for something else before I use this live?

**MentorAI:**

Suggestion: tighten to this and you’re set—“In today’s client kickoff, when you started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice, I lost my place and missed the data‑migration caveat, so I had to follow up after the call.” It drops “on Zoom” (not needed), keeps “twice” for useful specificity, and uses the most neutral behavior phrasing. Want to run with that version?
