**MentorAI:**

Quick check: we’re working on giving peer feedback using the SBI framework so it’s anchored to a real moment, names only observable behavior, and uses owned impact language. I’ll model how I do it, then we’ll shift to you practicing on your own situation. Ready to jump in?

**amara_SBI:**

Yep, I’m ready. Go ahead with your example.

**MentorAI:**

Here’s a quick think‑aloud with a concrete scenario, showing the choices I make and why:

1) Pick the moment: I’m choosing “Tuesday’s standup” instead of “lately,” because the anchor needs to be a recognizable moment.
2) Name only what a camera could see/hear: I’m avoiding “you cut me off” (judgment-y shorthand) and going with “you started talking while I was mid‑sentence and proposed a workaround.”
3) Own the impact: I’ll use my internal state and consequence: “I felt flustered and lost my train of thought; I skipped a blocker.”
4) Draft it together:
   - “In Tuesday’s standup, while I was sharing my update about the API, you started talking while I was mid‑sentence to propose a workaround. I felt thrown off and lost my train of thought, and I didn’t share my second blocker.”
5) Quick self‑check: Anchor = real moment (yes). Behavior = camera‑testable (yes). Impact = my feeling/experience, not a value judgment (yes). I’ll keep “started talking while I was mid‑sentence” instead of “cut me off” to avoid judgment leak.

I’ll pause there—your move when you’re ready.

**amara_SBI:**

In our standups lately, you keep cutting me off and dismissing my concerns. It makes the meeting tense, you make the team uncomfortable, and it derails our progress.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds charged—and that’s common with this kind of feedback. You’re not missing something obvious. Which part do you think is farthest from the criteria—the moment, the behavior, or the impact?

**amara_SBI:**

I think it’s mostly fine overall—none of those parts really stands out as off to me. If anything, maybe just the tone a bit.

**MentorAI:**

Let’s run your self-check on that draft: does it name a real moment, describe camera‑visible behavior, and use owned impact language? Walk me through your pass/fail for each and what tipped you there.

**amara_SBI:**

- Moment: Pass. I said “in our standups lately,” which feels like a clear timeframe for when this happens.
- Behavior: Pass. “Cutting me off” and “dismissing my concerns” are pretty straightforward descriptions of what they did.
- Impact: Pass. I said it makes the meeting tense and makes the team uncomfortable and derails progress—that shows the effect, so I think that works.

**MentorAI:**

Walk me through your choice to anchor it to “in our standups lately” rather than one specific standup—what were you optimizing for with that?

**amara_SBI:**

I was trying to show it’s a pattern, not just a one-off moment. I didn’t have a specific standup in mind, and saying “lately” felt more accurate. Also, I didn’t want it to sound like I was nitpicking one meeting.

**MentorAI:**

Your reason makes sense—showing a pattern matters. In SBI, though, we still anchor to one real moment; then you can note it’s part of a pattern after. Pick one specific standup someone there would recognize (e.g., “last Thursday’s standup when I started my update on X”) and do a full redo using that concrete anchor—keep the rest as-is for now. Your turn.

**amara_SBI:**

In our standups lately, when I start my update on the API, you keep cutting me off and dismissing my concerns. It makes the meeting tense, you make the team uncomfortable, and it derails our progress.

**MentorAI:**

You’ve still got “in our standups lately,” which is a pattern, not a single moment—what one specific standup will you anchor to (e.g., “Tuesday’s standup when I started my API update”)?

**amara_SBI:**

Tuesday’s standup when I started my API update.

**MentorAI:**

Good—now draft the full message using that anchor, with behavior I could see/hear and your own felt/experienced impact, all together in one go.

**amara_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s standup, when I started my API update, you began talking while I was mid-sentence to suggest a different approach. I felt thrown off and lost my train of thought, and I ended up skipping my second blocker.

**MentorAI:**

Before I weigh in, what—if anything—would you expect me to push on in that draft?

**amara_SBI:**

Honestly, I think it’s solid as-is. Maybe the tone could be a bit softer, but I don’t see much else you’d push on.

**MentorAI:**

Run the quick self-check on your draft: real moment? camera‑testable behavior? owned impact? Call pass/fail for each—and if any feel “almost,” say what you’d tighten.

**amara_SBI:**

- Real moment: Pass — “Tuesday’s standup” is a clear anchor.
- Camera-testable behavior: Pass — “began talking while I was mid-sentence to suggest a different approach” describes what happened.
- Owned impact: Pass — “I felt thrown off… lost my train of thought… skipped my second blocker” is my experience.

If anything, maybe I’d soften the tone a touch, but structurally it seems fine.

**MentorAI:**

That meets the bar 👍

Second practice—variation with higher stakes: After Friday’s customer call with Acme, your director jumped in while you were mid-sentence, said “we don’t need to go into that,” and redirected the conversation. Draft your full SBI message to your director about that moment—all in one go. Your turn.

**amara_SBI:**

On our customer calls lately, you’ve been cutting me off and shutting me down when I’m explaining details. It makes the conversation awkward, you undermine me in front of the client, and it derails the discussion.

**MentorAI:**

What lands: clear signal you’re naming a pattern and the stakes. Miss: it’s not anchored to the specific Friday Acme call I gave—you went with “lately.”

Give it another pass using that single moment and send the full message.

**amara_SBI:**

In Friday’s customer call with Acme, while I was mid‑sentence answering the integration question, you jumped in, said “we don’t need to go into that,” and redirected the conversation. I felt thrown off and hesitant to add more, and I didn’t finish outlining the API dependency and timeline risk.

**MentorAI:**

That lands. What works: a specific Friday Acme anchor, camera‑visible behavior with the exact quote, and owned impact with a concrete consequence. What principle from this will you carry forward?

**amara_SBI:**

Anchor feedback to a single, recognizable moment first—then, if needed, note it’s part of a pattern—using only camera‑visible behavior and my owned impact. That keeps it specific and less likely to trigger defensiveness.

**MentorAI:**

That’s the muscle to build: keep running your three-beat self-check—moment, camera‑visible behavior, owned impact—and whenever you hear yourself say “lately” or a judgment (“cutting me off”), translate it to a single recognizable moment and what a camera would capture; that habit will keep your feedback clean and defensible 👍

**amara_SBI:**

Got it—I’ll keep running that three‑beat self‑check and swap “lately” or judgments for a specific moment and camera‑visible actions, with owned impact.

**MentorAI:**

Works for me—you’re set. Nice work today.

**amara_SBI:**

Thanks—I’ll use that three‑beat check next time.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—before your next feedback moment, take 10 seconds to run the three beats aloud (moment, camera‑visible behavior, owned impact), then deliver; let me know how it goes.

**amara_SBI:**

Will do. I’ll run the three beats out loud before my next feedback and let you know how it goes.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good. When you report back, share the exact wording you used for the behavior and what happened right after—we’ll tune from there 👍

**amara_SBI:**

Got it—I’ll share the exact behavior wording I use and what happened right after when I report back.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good—looking forward to it. As you debrief, notice if you had to translate any judgment-y phrasing into camera‑visible language; that’s a good signal you’re catching yourself. Talk soon.

**amara_SBI:**

Will do—I’ll note any spots where I translate judgment-y phrasing into camera‑visible language and include that in my debrief, along with the exact wording and what happened next.

**MentorAI:**

Nice—one add: capture a tiny “translation list” as you go (judgment-y phrase → camera‑visible wording); those pairs become your shortcuts next time. Bring 2–3 pairs with your debrief and we’ll tune from there.

**amara_SBI:**

Sounds good—I’ll keep a small translation list (judgment-y phrase → camera‑visible wording) and bring 2–3 pairs with my debrief.

**MentorAI:**

Perfect. Right after the meeting, jot those pairs and your exact behavior wording while it’s fresh—two lines is plenty. Bring them when you check in and we’ll tune from there 👍

**amara_SBI:**

Will do—I’ll jot the pairs and my exact behavior wording right after the meeting and bring them to our check‑in.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds good. Once you’ve jotted them, send those two lines my way and we’ll pick it up in the debrief.
