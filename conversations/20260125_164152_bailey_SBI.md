**MentorAI:**

We’ll work on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success looks like: a real, specific moment for the situation, camera-testable behavior, and impact phrased in your own experience. I’ll demonstrate my process first so you can see the choices—ready to start?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes—ready. I’m really glad you’ll show your process first. Do you want me to take notes as you go, or just listen and then try it after? Also, quick check: when you say “camera-testable behavior,” is that like something you could actually see on a recording—no guessing what someone was thinking? I think that makes sense, but I just want to be sure before we start.

**MentorAI:**

Good questions. For the demo, just listen and jot light notes—write “S/B/I” and any choice points I call out; no need to transcribe. And yes, “camera-testable” means something you could see/hear on a recording—words, actions, timing, tone—not motives or traits. If that clicks, I’ll start the think‑aloud next—ready for the demo?

**bailey_SBI:**

Yes, I’m ready. I’ll keep light notes with S/B/I at the top and jot the choice points you call out.

I think “camera-testable” clicks—like “you looked at your phone for about 30 seconds” or “you spoke while I was mid-sentence,” versus “you didn’t care.” For tone, is it okay if it’s something like “your volume went up and your pace got faster,” but not “you sounded annoyed”? Just checking.

And if I get lost, is it okay to ask you to pause for a quick check-in? Does that all sound right before you start?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—your read is right: “volume went up and pace got faster” is observable; “sounded annoyed” isn’t. And yep, jump in to pause if you need a quick check.

Here’s the think‑aloud, step by step:
1) Pick the moment: I’m choosing Tuesday’s standup, right after I started sharing blockers. It’s specific enough that both of us can picture it.
2) Behavior options: I could say “you interrupted me,” but that edges toward a label. Better: “you started speaking while I was mid‑sentence—twice; the second time continued about 20 seconds, and your volume was higher and pace quicker.” That’s camera‑testable.
3) Impact (owned): “I felt flustered and lost my train of thought; my stomach tightened; I skipped raising a blocker, so we left without a plan for it.” That’s my experience and a direct consequence I had.
4) Draft it together: “In Tuesday’s standup, right after I began sharing blockers, you started speaking while I was mid‑sentence—twice; the second time went about 20 seconds, with higher volume and faster pace. I felt flustered and lost my train of thought, and I held back a blocker, so we left without a plan for it.”
5) Quick self‑check: Moment is specific? Yes. Behavior observable? Yes. Impact owned (feelings/consequence I had), not a judgment? Yes.

Before we lock in a self‑check routine, how would you check your own SBI draft to be sure it meets the bar?

**bailey_SBI:**

Okay, I think I’d try to do a quick scan like this—but I might be off:

- Situation: I’d ask myself “Can we both picture the exact moment?” But I get stuck on whether “Tuesday’s standup, right after I started blockers” is specific enough, or if I need like “9:03 a.m.” And if there are multiple Tuesdays, I worry that’s too vague.

- Behavior: I’d look for anything that isn’t camera/mic testable. But I can’t tell if words like “interrupted” are already a label. Should I rewrite as “you started speaking while I was mid‑sentence” every time? Also, “volume higher/faster pace” feels observable, but is “quicker” too subjective unless I have a number?

- Impact: I’d check for “I…” language, but I get confused about “I felt like…” versus “I felt…” Is “I felt like my input didn’t matter” a feeling or a story? And “I felt flustered”—is that too dramatic? Part of me wants to soften it, and then it starts sounding wishy‑washy.

Maybe I’d also glance at length—if it’s getting long, I’d try to cut something—but I’m not sure which part is safe to trim without losing clarity.

Sorry, that’s kind of messy. Could you tell me if this is the right kind of self‑check? And if there’s a simpler 2–3 question test I can memorize, that would help me not spiral. Am I anywhere close?

**MentorAI:**

You’re right on track—messy is normal at this stage, and you’re noticing the exact friction points people hit 👍

Try this 3-step self-check you can memorize:
1) Moment: Would we both point to the same meeting moment with one clear anchor (e.g., “Tuesday standup, after I started blockers”)? No timestamps needed—if there were multiple, add one tiny cue (“the standup where we discussed the beta bug”).
2) Behavior: Could a camera/mic capture it as written—words/actions/timing—no motives or traits? If a verb’s debatable (“interrupted”), swap to what happened (“started talking while I was mid-sentence”). Comparatives like “louder/faster” are fine; numbers optional.
3) Impact: Does it name my internal state or a direct consequence without “felt like” or “you made me…”? Emotions/physical sensations (“I felt flustered; my stomach tightened”) or practical fallout (“I skipped a blocker”) pass.

When you’re set, give me a “ready” and we’ll run a quick one-line test with this.

**bailey_SBI:**

Got it—thank you. My takeaway for the self-check is:
- Moment: one clear anchor we’d both recognize (add a tiny cue if needed).
- Behavior: camera/mic could capture it—words/actions/timing; swap labels for what actually happened; “louder/faster” is okay without numbers.
- Impact: my experience or a concrete consequence, using “I felt…” (not “I felt like…” or “you made me…”).

Quick check: words like “I felt scattered” or “I felt tense” count as feelings, right, but “I felt like my input didn’t matter” is a story?

If that’s right, I’m ready. For the one-line test, will you give me the moment to use, or should I pick one?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—“I felt scattered” and “I felt tense” are feelings; “I felt like my input didn’t matter” is a story. If you want that idea, own it as an emotion or consequence (e.g., “I felt discouraged” or “I hesitated to speak up”).

One-line test: “In yesterday’s design review, while I was presenting the mockups, you said ‘Can we move on?’ before I finished; I felt tense and lost my train of thought.” Does this pass your 3-step check?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think it mostly passes, but a few spots make me second‑guess—can I sanity‑check them?

- Moment: “Yesterday’s design review, while I was presenting the mockups.” That feels specific, but I worry “yesterday” is a little relative or, if we’ve had multiple design reviews, not unique enough. Would adding a tiny cue like “the review where we discussed the mobile nav” be better, or is that overkill?

- Behavior: Quoting “Can we move on?” sounds perfectly camera/mic‑testable. I’m stuck on “before I finished”—is that observable enough, or should it be “while I was mid‑sentence” or “while I was still on slide 3” to make it more concrete? Also, do quotes need to be the exact words, or is close paraphrase okay?

- Impact: “I felt tense and lost my train of thought.” Tense is a feeling, and losing my train of thought seems like a consequence I experienced. Is it okay to mix those in one line, or should I separate them? Part of me worries “tense” sounds a bit strong, but maybe that’s me softening again.

If these aren’t real problems, I’m happy to keep it as is. If you’d want one minimal tweak, which would you pick? Sorry if I’m overthinking—am I at least checking the right things?

**MentorAI:**

You’re checking the right things—this is exactly the layer to fuss about, not overthinking.

If I made one minimal tweak, it’d be to anchor the moment with a tiny cue so it’s uniquely pointable: “Yesterday’s design review—the one where we discussed the mobile nav…”

Your turn: give me a complete SBI for a real moment with a peer (2–3 sentences, all three parts together). I’ll read it straight, then ask where you think I’ll push back.

**bailey_SBI:**

In our team sync earlier this week—maybe Tuesday?—when we were going over the dashboard changes, you were on your phone a few times and kind of seemed checked out. I guess it made things feel a bit off, and I felt like maybe I should just wrap up quickly, so I might have skipped some details that could’ve helped—I’m not totally sure if that’s fair.

**MentorAI:**

I hear some hedging and second‑guessing—totally normal at this stage; you’re right in the hard part. Where do you think I’ll push back first—on the moment, the behavior, or the impact? Pick one and tell me why.

**bailey_SBI:**

I think you’ll push back first on the behavior. I said “seemed checked out,” which I’m realizing is my interpretation, not something a camera would capture. And “on your phone a few times” is fuzzy—do I need to say exactly how many, like “twice,” for it to pass? Also, is it okay to call out “on your phone” directly, or does that sound accusatory? I can’t tell if I’m inventing a problem there.

Part of me wonders you’d start with the moment, since I said “earlier this week—maybe Tuesday?” which isn’t uniquely pointable. But if I have to pick one, I’ll say behavior because I mixed what I saw with a story. Is that where you’d go first?

**MentorAI:**

You’re reading it correctly—“seemed checked out” is an interpretation; “on your phone” is observable and fine. You don’t need exact counts; if you remember it, use it, otherwise a short cue like “several times during the dashboard segment” works.

Focus on one thing: rewrite just the behavior as a single camera/mic‑testable sentence for that dashboard portion—no motives or traits. Your version?

**bailey_SBI:**

During the dashboard segment, you picked up your phone and looked down at it several times—including a stretch of about 20 seconds while I was on the KPI slide—and you didn’t respond when I paused and asked “does that make sense?,” which made it seem like you were checked out.

**MentorAI:**

The core of this is solid—“picked up your phone… looked down… ~20 seconds on the KPI slide… no response to ‘does that make sense?’” is all camera-testable. What led you to add the final clause, “which made it seem like you were checked out”?

**bailey_SBI:**

Honestly, I added it because the bare facts felt too thin, and I got worried they wouldn’t understand why it mattered. I guess I thought if I didn’t name “checked out,” they might shrug it off as “I just glanced at my phone,” so I tried to connect the dots—and probably drifted into interpretation to make it land.

I’m thinking that “meaning” should live in the impact instead—like “I felt uneasy and wasn’t sure whether to keep going when there was no response”—or maybe as a curious follow‑up question rather than in the behavior. Does that sound right? Sorry for mixing it in—I just didn’t trust that the facts plus impact would be enough.

**MentorAI:**

That’s exactly it—the “meaning” lives in your impact (or in a curious follow-up after the SBI). It can feel thin without the label; trust that clear behavior + owned impact is what makes it land.

Let’s put it all together now. Write a complete SBI for this same moment: anchor a single, recognizable meeting moment (add a tiny cue if needed), keep the behavior camera-testable (drop “checked out”), and name your internal state or direct consequence. Two–three sentences—your draft.

**bailey_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s team sync—the one where we reviewed the dashboard updates right after Alex flagged the beta bug—I was presenting the KPI slide. During that part, you picked up your phone and looked down at it for about 20 seconds, then again for around 10 seconds, and when I paused and asked “does that make sense?” there was about a three‑second silence with no response. I felt tense and a bit scattered, and I felt like I should just rush, so I think I probably skipped the notes on the anomaly filter.

Is that closer, or did I overdo the details?

**MentorAI:**

You’re not overdoing it—this is the spot where people worry about “too much” detail; you’re close. Before I weigh in, what’s the one place you’d expect me to push back here—the moment anchor, the behavior specifics, or the impact phrasing?

**bailey_SBI:**

Impact phrasing. I slipped back into “felt like” with “I felt like I should just rush,” and I hedged with “I think I probably skipped…,” which doesn’t really own the consequence. I’m also not sure if “scattered” is okay as a feeling or if that’s getting fuzzy.

Is that the right spot you’d push on first? If so, I can try tightening it to own the emotion and the consequence more directly.

**MentorAI:**

Yep—that’s the spot. And “scattered” is a legit feeling; you don’t need to soften it.

Try this one tweak: make it one sentence that names your emotion and the direct consequence—no “felt like,” no “probably.” As in, “I felt X, and I Y.” Your one‑sentence impact for this moment?

**bailey_SBI:**

I felt tense and kind of scattered, and I think I rushed to wrap up and might have skipped mentioning the anomaly filter. 

Is that too hedged—should I make it more direct?

**MentorAI:**

You spotted it—the hedging is what blunts it. This part trips people up because softening feels safer.

Suggestion: drop “I think” and “might have,” keep the emotion words you actually felt, and name the specific consequence you know happened (“I rushed to wrap up and skipped the anomaly filter”). Go ahead and write that as one clean sentence now.

**bailey_SBI:**

I felt tense and scattered, and I rushed to wrap up and skipped mentioning the anomaly filter.

Does that land better, or is “skipped the anomaly filter” cleaner?

**MentorAI:**

That lands. “Skipped the anomaly filter” is a touch cleaner than “skipped mentioning…”—both pass 👍

Drop that into your full SBI for this moment and send the whole thing.

**bailey_SBI:**

In Tuesday’s team sync—the one where we reviewed the dashboard updates right after Alex flagged the beta bug—I was presenting the KPI slide. During that part, you picked up your phone and looked down at it for about 20 seconds, then again for around 10 seconds, and when I paused and asked “does that make sense?” there was about a three‑second silence with no response. I felt tense and scattered, and I rushed to wrap up and skipped the anomaly filter.

Does that read clean to you, or would you trim anything?

**MentorAI:**

That reads clean and meets the bar. If you want one tiny trim, swap “about a three‑second silence with no response” for “a brief pause with no response”—same signal, fewer words.

We’ll take a variation next for round two.

**bailey_SBI:**

Got it—thank you. I noted the tiny trim (“a brief pause with no response”)—do you want me to swap that in now, or save it and move on?

I’m ready for round two. Would you like to give me the new moment, or should I pick one? I can try a different flavor if that’s helpful—like a positive/affirming version, or a remote-call scenario where tone/pace is the main behavior, or something like late responses in Slack. What would you prefer?

**MentorAI:**

Let’s move on. Here’s your variation: On Wednesday’s Zoom demo with Acme—your manager and two client leads were on—the moment is when you were explaining the anomaly filter. In that stretch, your peer posted “Can we move on?” in the meeting chat and then started speaking while you were mid‑sentence for about 15 seconds. Give me your full SBI for this—2–3 sentences, all together.

**bailey_SBI:**

In the Zoom demo with Acme on Wednesday—I think it was Wednesday?—when I was explaining the anomaly filter (with our manager and the two client leads on), you posted “Can we move on?” in the chat and then started speaking while I was mid‑sentence for about 15 seconds, which came across as a bit dismissive. I guess it made things feel a little off, and I felt like I should rush, so I might have skimmed past some context and probably didn’t explain the filter clearly.

Is that in the ballpark, or did I mess up the tone of it?

**MentorAI:**

What works: the moment is anchored to a recognizable demo, and the behavior has camera-testable pieces (the quoted chat and mid-sentence speaking for ~15s).

Miss: judgment leaked into the behavior with “came across as a bit dismissive.”

Tighten that one spot and resend your full 2–3 sentences.

**bailey_SBI:**

In Wednesday’s Zoom demo with Acme—while I was explaining the anomaly filter, with our manager and two client leads on—you posted “Can we move on?” in the meeting chat and then started speaking while I was mid‑sentence for about 15 seconds. I felt tense and lost my thread, and I rushed and skimmed past context on the filter.

Does this hit the bar better, or would you tweak anything else?

**MentorAI:**

That hits the bar—clear moment, camera-testable behavior (the chat quote and mid-sentence ~15s), and an owned impact that names both feeling and consequence. 👍

One reflection: what’s the single principle you’ll carry forward to keep judgment out of the behavior while still making the “why it mattered” land?

**bailey_SBI:**

I think the principle is: keep the behavior strictly camera/mic‑testable, and put the “why it mattered” in my impact—name my feeling and a direct consequence (I felt X, and Y happened). Does that sound like the right north star?

**MentorAI:**

Yes—that’s the north star. One takeaway to keep you clean under pressure: whenever you hear yourself reaching for “seemed/came across/felt like,” swap the behavior to the bare action and move the meaning into “I felt X, and Y happened.” That’s it—this is ready for real conversations now. 👍

**bailey_SBI:**

Thank you—that north star really helps. I’m still a little nervous I only got there because you walked me through it, so a tiny safety net would help.

- Do you have a quick “pocket” version I can say to myself before I speak—like a 10‑second checklist or an opener line (e.g., “Can I share an observation?”) so I don’t default to “seemed/came across…” under pressure?
- And could you give me one simple homework rep for this week—like how many SBIs to draft or try live—so I know I’m practicing the right way?

Does that make sense? I want to keep this clean when I’m not in a safe practice setting.

**MentorAI:**

Totally normal to feel a little wobbly outside practice—you’ve got the structure; a tiny safety net will steady you 👍

Pocket check (10 seconds, in your head):
- Moment: “Can we both point to the same moment? One cue if needed.”
- Behavior: “What would a camera/mic capture? No ‘seemed/came across.’”
- Impact: “I felt X, and Y happened.” If you hear “felt like…,” swap to that.

Easy opener you can use:
- “Can I share a quick observation from [moment]?”
- Or just start clean: “In [moment], when [behavior], I felt [emotion] and [consequence].”

Homework this week: draft two SBIs from real moments (2–3 sentences each), and deliver one live. Run the pocket check before you speak and, afterward, note any judgment words you caught and cut.

Your move: pick the opener you’ll actually use and say it out loud once before your next conversation.

**bailey_SBI:**

The opener I’ll use is: “Can I share a quick observation from yesterday’s design review?” 

Does that sound natural enough for a real conversation? I can practice it a couple more times if you think I should tweak the wording.

**MentorAI:**

Sounds natural as is—you’re good 👍

If you want one micro‑tweak for live settings, add time‑bound permission: “Can I share a quick observation from yesterday’s design review? It’ll take under a minute—now okay?”

Say your chosen version out loud once, and you’re set.
