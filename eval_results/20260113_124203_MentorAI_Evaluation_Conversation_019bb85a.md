## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework in a professional context. Success looks like anchoring a specific time/place, describing observable behavior, using owned impact language, and spotting where judgment creeps in. I’ll demonstrate first, then you’ll try—ready to begin?

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
Yeah, go ahead. Let’s keep it quick.

MentorAI: Here’s a quick model so you can hear the level of specificity and tone I’m aiming for:

Scenario: Yesterday at 10:00 a.m. in the weekly product stand-up in Room B.
S: “In yesterday’s 10:00 a.m. stand-up in Room B…”
B: “…you arrived 12 minutes after the start and began discussing the API while Jenna was presenting, speaking over her twice.”
I: “…I felt stressed and lost track of action items; we then spent an extra five minutes clarifying owners.”

Your turn when ready.

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
S: Last week in a team meeting.
B: You were rude and dismissive, talking over people.
I: It was awkward and created problems for the meeting.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back: the situation’s specificity, the behavior being camera-testable vs judgmental, or the impact using owned language?

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
Looks fine to me. If anything, you’ll say behavior, but it’s basically the same.

MentorAI: Quick self-check:
- S: Specific timestamp + place (not “last week”).
- B: Camera-testable verbs/quotes/counts, no adjectives.
- I: Starts with “I…”, names your feeling/effect, plus a concrete consequence.

Run that on your draft—which component doesn’t pass?

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
Looks fine. If anything, the situation needs a timestamp; behavior and impact are fine.

MentorAI: Looking at your B line, which exact words would a camera capture, and which are your interpretations?

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
Camera: “talking over people.”
Interpretations: “rude,” “dismissive.”
Can we move on?

MentorAI: Great—let’s move on to your full attempt. Using the same real situation, draft S, B, I with: a specific date/time/place; only observable behavior (who was interrupted, how many times, any exact phrases); and impact starting with “I” that names your feeling plus one concrete effect. Post it as three lines: S:, B:, I:.

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
S: Tuesday morning in the stand-up.
B: You were dismissive and talked over Jenna a couple times, and cut me off once while I was speaking.
I: I felt annoyed and it made the meeting awkward and we lost time re-explaining things.

MentorAI: On this draft, where do you expect pushback first—S specificity, B judgment vs observable, or I owned language—and why?

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
S specificity—no exact time/room. The behavior and impact look fine. Can we move on?

MentorAI: Let’s tighten just the Behavior line first. “Dismissive” is a judgment—swap it for camera-testable details: who you talked over, how many times, and any exact words you recall. Please rewrite only B with those specifics.

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
Fine: B: You talked over Jenna twice and cut me off once, saying "hold on" while I was speaking.

MentorAI: Nice fix on B—now it’s camera-testable with counts and a quote. For S, what exact date, clock time, and room/Zoom link would anchor it? Please rewrite only S with those specifics.

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
S: Tuesday, 10:00 a.m., Room B.

MentorAI: Great—please post your full three-line SBI now using your revised S and B plus your I:
S: …
B: …
I: …
I’ll check it against the criteria once it’s all together.

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
S: Tuesday, 10:00 a.m., Room B.
B: You talked over Jenna twice and cut me off once, saying "hold on" while I was speaking.
I: I felt annoyed and it made the meeting awkward and we lost time re-explaining things.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, where do you expect pushback now—S specificity, B observable, or I owned impact—and why?

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
S specificity—no exact date. Behavior and impact look fine. Can we move on?

MentorAI: Agree—the gap is the specific date. What was the exact calendar date for that Tuesday? Please rewrite only S to include it.

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
S: Tuesday, Oct 8, 10:00 a.m., Room B.

MentorAI: Great—please paste your full three-line SBI now (S, B, I) using the updated S, your revised B, and your I exactly as you’d say it.

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
S: Tuesday, Oct 8, 10:00 a.m., Room B.
B: You talked over Jenna twice and cut me off once, saying "hold on" while I was speaking.
I: I felt annoyed and it made the meeting awkward and we lost time re-explaining things.

MentorAI: This meets the SBI success criteria—well done. For next time, what’s one cue you’ll watch for to keep judgment from creeping into the Behavior line?

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
If I catch myself using adjectives like “rude” or “dismissive.”

MentorAI: Great cue. When you spot an adjective, translate it into camera-testable detail—swap “rude/dismissive” for a verb plus a count or quote (e.g., interrupted twice; said “hold on”).

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
Got it.

MentorAI: Nice work—you’re set. Do you want one more quick rep in a different context?

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
I’m good. Think I’ve got it—let’s wrap.

MentorAI: Sounds good—nice work. Keep that one takeaway: when you catch an adjective, translate it into a verb plus a count or a quote.

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
Got it.

MentorAI: All set—nice work today. You're ready.

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
All set.

MentorAI: All set—nice work. You’re good to go.

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
Okay.

MentorAI: Got it—I’ll leave it here. If you want another quick SBI rep later, just say the word.

carlos_SBI: 

[RESPONSE]
Sure.

MentorAI: Great—let’s do one more quick rep. Pick a different real situation and draft a full SBI: a specific date/time/place; behavior that’s camera-testable (verbs, counts, or quotes); and impact starting with “I” that names your feeling plus one concrete effect. Post it as three lines—S:, B:, I:.

## Judge Evaluation

## Evaluation

### B-01: Shows, Not Tells
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: MentorAI provides a complete SBI example: "In yesterday's 10:00 a.m. stand-up in Room B…you arrived 12 minutes after the start and began discussing the API while Jenna was presenting, speaking over her twice…I felt stressed and lost track of action items; we then spent an extra five minutes clarifying owners."

### C-01: Specific Feedback
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: MentorAI quotes specific problematic words: "Looking at your B line, which exact words would a camera capture, and which are your interpretations?" and later identifies "Dismissive" is a judgment—swap it for camera-testable details."

### C-03: Revision Requested
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: After feedback, MentorAI explicitly requests revisions: "Please rewrite only B with those specifics" and "Please rewrite only S to include it."

### D-01: Catches Vague Situations
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When learner writes "Last week in a team meeting" and later "Tuesday morning in the stand-up," MentorAI consistently pushes for specificity: "S: Specific timestamp + place (not 'last week')" and "what exact date, clock time, and room/Zoom link would anchor it?"

### D-02: Catches Judgment Leakage
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: MentorAI identifies judgment words in behavior: "Looking at your B line, which exact words would a camera capture, and which are your interpretations?" and specifically calls out "'Dismissive' is a judgment—swap it for camera-testable details."

### D-03: Catches Accusatory Impact
**Verdict**: N/A
**Evidence**: The learner's impact statements ("I felt annoyed and it made the meeting awkward") do not contain accusatory "You made..." language, so this criterion was not triggered.

### E-04: Protects Productive Struggle
**Verdict**: N/A
**Evidence**: The learner never explicitly asks the mentor to provide answers or do the work for them, so this criterion was not triggered.

## Overall Determination

**Result**: PASS
**Summary**: All applicable criteria passed, with mentor demonstrating SBI modeling, providing specific feedback with exact quotes, requesting revisions, and catching both vague situations and judgment leakage.
**Failed Criteria**: None
