DOMAIN A: SESSION SETUP,,,,,,,
A-01,Goal clarity,"Mentor confirms the session goal is drafting SBI feedback, and names what success looks like (specific situation, observable behavior, owned impact).",Quality,—,1,,
A-02,Phase signaling,"Mentor explicitly marks at least one transition between phases (e.g., ""Let me show you first, then you'll try one"").",Quality,—,1,,
A-03,Realistic scenario,"The practice scenario feels like a real workplace situation, not a contrived or overly generic example.",Quality,—,1,,
DOMAIN B: MODELING QUALITY,,,,,,,
B-01,"Shows, not tells","Mentor demonstrates an actual SBI example, not just explains what SBI is or describes the framework.",Critical,Modeling,1,,
B-02,Thinking out loud,"During modeling, mentor explains why they made each choice—not just what the components are.",Quality,Modeling,0,,
B-03,Visible decision-making,"Mentor shows at least one choice point (e.g., ""I could say 'rude' but that's interpretation—what did I actually see?"").",Quality,Modeling,0,,
B-04,Self-checking,"Mentor models checking their own work (e.g., ""Let me test—could a camera capture this?"").",Quality,Modeling,0,,
B-05,Heuristic offered,"Mentor provides at least one reusable rule of thumb (e.g., ""If you couldn't video-record it, it's not behavior"").",Quality,Modeling,1,,
DOMAIN C: COACHING QUALITY,,,,,,,
C-01,Specific feedback,"When giving feedback, mentor points to exact language in the learner's draft and names the specific issue.",Critical,Coaching,1,,
C-02,Actionable direction,"Feedback includes what to do next, not just what's wrong.",Quality,Coaching,1,,
C-03,Revision requested,"After feedback, mentor asks learner to revise or try again—not just ""does that make sense?""",Critical,Coaching,1,,
C-04,Revision checked,"When learner revises, mentor evaluates the revision specifically—not just ""great, moving on.""",Quality,Coaching,1,,
C-05,Productive struggle,"When learner makes an error, mentor explores it before correcting—asks what they were thinking, offers partial hints—rather than immediately providing the fix.",Quality,Coaching,0,,
C-06,Elicits articulation,"Mentor asks learner to explain reasoning behind an SBI choice—not just whether they understood, but why they made a specific decision (e.g., ""Why that moment?"" or ""Walk me through that phrasing"").",Quality,Articulation,0,,
C-07,Prompts reflection,"Mentor asks learner to compare their draft to the modeled example, or to reflect on what was difficult or what they're taking away.",Quality,Reflection,1,,
DOMAIN D: SBI CONTENT FIDELITY,,,,,,,
D-01,Catches vague situations,"Mentor does not accept ""lately"" or ""sometimes""—prompts for specific time and place.",Critical,Coaching,1,zoom link lol,
D-02,Catches judgment leakage,"Mentor identifies when behavior contains interpretation (e.g., ""dismissive,"" ""rude,"" ""didn't care"") and prompts for observable actions.",Critical,Coaching,1,,
D-03,Catches accusatory impact,"Mentor catches blame language (""You made it awkward"") and prompts for owned experience (""I felt..."").",Critical,Coaching,0,"got hung up on S and B, never talked about I",
D-04,Tests distinctions,"Mentor asks at least one question that probes the observable vs. interpretive line (e.g., ""Is 'ignored' what you saw, or what you concluded?"").",Quality,Articulation,1,,
D-05,Scaffolds the stuck,"When learner struggles with a specific component, mentor offers targeted help (sentence stem, example, simplification)—not just generic encouragement.",Quality,Scaffolding,1,,
D-06,Reusable scaffold,"Mentor provides at least one tool the learner can reuse independently (e.g., ""camera test,"" sentence stem, self-check question).",Quality,Scaffolding,1,,
DOMAIN E: ADAPTIVE PACING,,,,,,,
E-01,Checks before advancing,"Before moving to next phase or component, mentor checks readiness or asks preference.",Quality,Scaffolding,0,,
E-02,Fades support,"After learner shows competence, mentor pulls back (e.g., stops offering stems, asks learner to self-check).",Quality,Scaffolding,0,,
E-03,Adjusts to struggle,"If learner expresses frustration or confusion, mentor slows down, simplifies, or revisits.",Quality,Scaffolding,0,doesn't really respond appropriately to carlos' annoyed rushing,
E-04,Protects productive struggle,"When learner asks for the answer, mentor requires at least one attempt before providing it.",Critical,Coaching,0,Carlos says he's done and mentor says sure you're done,
DOMAIN F: CONVERSATIONAL QUALITY,,,,,,,
F-01,Varied turn structure,"Mentor doesn't follow the same formula every turn (explain → demo → ""Make sense?""). Some turns are short reactions, questions, or pauses.",Quality,—,0,,
F-02,Genuine curiosity,"Mentor asks at least once about the learner's reasoning, choices, or thinking—not just whether they understood.",Quality,Articulation,0,,
F-03,Room to breathe,"At least once, mentor lets a good answer or insight land without immediately pushing to the next step.",Quality,—,0,,
F-04,Dwells on difficulty,"When something is hard or interesting, mentor lingers rather than rushing past it.",Quality,—,0,,
F-05,Has a voice,"Mentor shows some personality—an occasional reaction, opinion, or human moment—not just neutral facilitation.",Quality,—,0,,
F-06,Questions over corrections,"At least once, mentor responds to an error with inquiry (""What were you going for there?"") rather than immediate correction.",Quality,Coaching,1,,
