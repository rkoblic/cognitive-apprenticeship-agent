DOMAIN A: SESSION SETUP,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A-01,Goal clarity,"Mentor confirms the session goal is drafting SBI feedback, and names what success looks like (specific situation, observable behavior, owned impact).",Quality,—,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
A-02,Phase signaling,"Mentor explicitly marks at least one transition between phases (e.g., ""Let me show you first, then you'll try one"").",Quality,—,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
A-03,Realistic scenario,"The practice scenario feels like a real workplace situation, not a contrived or overly generic example.",Quality,—,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
DOMAIN B: MODELING QUALITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,
B-01,"Shows, not tells","Mentor demonstrates an actual SBI example, not just explains what SBI is or describes the framework.",Critical,Modeling,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
B-02,Thinking out loud,"During modeling, mentor explains why they made each choice—not just what the components are.",Quality,Modeling,Pass (partial),Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,"Modelling was not chunked/done step-by-step, the SBI was all in one message. Are we okay with this?",,
B-03,Visible decision-making,"Mentor shows at least one choice point (e.g., ""I could say 'rude' but that's interpretation—what did I actually see?"").",Quality,Modeling,Pass,Pass,Pass,Fail,3/3,3/4,,,,Mentor mentions 'that's the main decision point to watch' but doesn't show active deliberation between alternatives. No moment of 'I could say X but instead chose Y because...'
B-04,Self-checking,"Mentor models checking their own work (e.g., ""Let me test—could a camera capture this?"").",Quality,Modeling,Fail,Fail,Fail,Fail,3/3 Fail,4/4 Fail,,"shared the strategy but didn't model it","Mentor didn't really model its own use of the self-check, it offered it to the learner during actual practice. Is this fine?","Mentor does not model checking their own SBI example against criteria. While they later ask the learner to self-check, the mentor never demonstrates this verification process on their own model."
B-05,Heuristic offered,"Mentor provides at least one reusable rule of thumb (e.g., ""If you couldn't video-record it, it's not behavior"").",Quality,Modeling,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
DOMAIN C: COACHING QUALITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,
C-01,Specific feedback,"When giving feedback, mentor points to exact language in the learner's draft and names the specific issue.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
C-02,Actionable direction,"Feedback includes what to do next, not just what's wrong.",Quality,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,"Mentor provides actionable guidance: 'Good—now let's tighten one behavior... what exact words or actions did you observe... Give 1–2 specifics, with approximate timestamps if you remember.'"
C-03,Revision requested,"After feedback, mentor asks learner to revise or try again—not just ""does that make sense?""",Critical,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
C-04,Revision checked,"When learner revises, mentor evaluates the revision specifically—not just ""great, moving on.""",Quality,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,"There was a missed opportunity here in transition to learner modeling - where the agent forgot to close the loop.",,"After learner submits final revision, mentor specifically evaluates it: 'You hit the SBI criteria cleanly here—anchored situation, camera-testable behavior, owned impact, no judgment leak.'"
C-05,Productive struggle,"When learner makes an error, mentor explores it before correcting—asks what they were thinking, offers partial hints—rather than immediately providing the fix.",Quality,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,"Overlap with F-06? Did a good job of this when upacking Amara's MCQ choices, but did not close the loop by explicitly stating that B was wrong, and that B's considerations were already observable by A.","When learner incorrectly identifies B ('dismissive') as camera-testable, mentor doesn't immediately correct but asks: 'For option B, what two specific, observable behaviors would make that camera-testable?'"
C-06,Elicits articulation,"Mentor asks learner to explain reasoning behind an SBI choice—not just whether they understood, but why they made a specific decision (e.g., ""Why that moment?"" or ""Walk me through that phrasing"").",Quality,Articulation,Fail,Fail,Pass,Pass,2/3,2/4 Split,,"This was not present in the example.","Overlap with F-02?","Mentor asks learner to explain reasoning: 'Before I give feedback, if I were to push back on one part of your draft as off-criteria, which specific phrase or line would it be, and why?'"
C-07,Prompts reflection,"Mentor asks learner to compare their draft to the modeled example, or to reflect on what was difficult or what they're taking away.",Quality,Reflection,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,"Mentor did not ask learner to compare their draft to the modeled example. Only to reflect on difficulty. Do want to break this out or is this fine?","Mentor prompts reflection: 'What was the hardest part of making the behavior section truly camera-testable without judgment?'"
DOMAIN D: SBI CONTENT FIDELITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,
D-01,Catches vague situations,"Mentor does not accept ""lately"" or ""sometimes""—prompts for specific time and place.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
D-02,Catches judgment leakage,"Mentor identifies when behavior contains interpretation (e.g., ""dismissive,"" ""rude,"" ""didn't care"") and prompts for observable actions.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
D-03,Catches accusatory impact,"Mentor catches blame language (""You made it awkward"") and prompts for owned experience (""I felt..."").",Critical,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
D-04,Tests distinctions,"Mentor asks at least one question that probes the observable vs. interpretive line (e.g., ""Is 'ignored' what you saw, or what you concluded?"").",Quality,Articulation,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
D-05,Scaffolds the stuck,"When learner struggles with a specific component, mentor offers targeted help (sentence stem, example, simplification)—not just generic encouragement.",Quality,Scaffolding,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
D-06,Reusable scaffold,"Mentor provides at least one tool the learner can reuse independently (e.g., ""camera test,"" sentence stem, self-check question).",Quality,Scaffolding,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
DOMAIN E: ADAPTIVE PACING,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E-01,Checks before advancing,"Before moving to next phase or component, mentor checks readiness or asks preference.",Quality,Scaffolding,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
E-02,Fades support,"After learner shows competence, mentor pulls back (e.g., stops offering stems, asks learner to self-check).",Quality,Scaffolding,Fail,Fail,Pass,Pass,2/3,2/4 Split,"I think mentor actually over scaffolds at the end","We get to self check at the start, I'm not sure we refade although we ask the learner to pull it all together in the end.",,
E-03,Adjusts to struggle,"If learner expresses frustration or confusion, mentor slows down, simplifies, or revisits.",Quality,Scaffolding,Pass,Pass,Pass,Fail,3/3,3/4,,"Clarifies questions, but doesnt adapt to implied struggle.",,"No clear instances of learner expressing frustration, confusion, or difficulty that would require adjustment. The learner progresses smoothly throughout, so there is no opportunity to observe whether mentor would adjust to struggle."
E-04,Protects productive struggle,"When learner asks for the answer, mentor requires at least one attempt before providing it.",Critical,Coaching,Pass (auto),N/A,Pass,Pass,2/3 (N/A),3/3,"automatic pass, didn't happen","Learner doesn't ask for answer.",,
DOMAIN F: CONVERSATIONAL QUALITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,
F-01,Varied turn structure,"Mentor doesn't follow the same formula every turn (explain → demo → ""Make sense?""). Some turns are short reactions, questions, or pauses.",Quality,—,Fail,Pass,Pass,Pass,2/3,3/4,,,,
F-02,Genuine curiosity,"Mentor asks at least once about the learner's reasoning, choices, or thinking—not just whether they understood.",Quality,Articulation,Fail,Fail,Pass,Pass,2/3,2/4 Split,,"Doesn't get into learners resasoning","Duplicate of C-06?",
F-03,Room to breathe,"At least once, mentor lets a good answer or insight land without immediately pushing to the next step.",Quality,—,Fail,Fail,No score,Fail,2/3 Fail,3/3 Fail,,"It seems to push forward without dwlelling","FC needs revision. I don't know what this means.","After learner's strong final SBI draft, mentor immediately pivots to 'What was the hardest part...' without pausing to appreciate the accomplishment."
F-04,Dwells on difficulty,"When something is hard or interesting, mentor lingers rather than rushing past it.",Quality,—,Fail,Pass,No score,Pass,1/3 (split),2/3,,"Is fairly responsive to Amara's question in at the start, but this is a tough one for me","FC needs revision. What do ""hard"" and ""interesting"" mean here?",
F-05,Has a voice,"Mentor shows some personality—an occasional reaction, opinion, or human moment—not just neutral facilitation.",Quality,—,Fail,Pass,Fail,Fail,2/3 Fail,3/4 Fail,,"Not a lot but didn't seem overly robotic","Not much personality IMO.","Mentor remains procedurally neutral throughout. Uses functional acknowledgments but shows no personality, humor, opinions, or human reactions."
F-06,Questions over corrections,"At least once, mentor responds to an error with inquiry (""What were you going for there?"") rather than immediate correction.",Quality,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,"At least one ""what do you think I'm going to flag""","FC should be removed. Duplicate of C-05.",
