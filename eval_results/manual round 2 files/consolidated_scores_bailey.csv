DOMAIN A: SESSION SETUP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A-01,Goal clarity,"Mentor confirms the session goal is drafting SBI feedback, and names what success looks like (specific situation, observable behavior, owned impact).",Quality,—,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,
A-02,Phase signaling,"Mentor explicitly marks at least one transition between phases (e.g., ""Let me show you first, then you'll try one"").",Quality,—,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,
A-03,Realistic scenario,"The practice scenario feels like a real workplace situation, not a contrived or overly generic example.",Quality,—,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,
DOMAIN B: MODELING QUALITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
B-01,"Shows, not tells","Mentor demonstrates an actual SBI example, not just explains what SBI is or describes the framework.",Critical,Modeling,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,
B-02,Thinking out loud,"During modeling, mentor explains why they made each choice—not just what the components are.",Quality,Modeling,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,
B-03,Visible decision-making,"Mentor shows at least one choice point (e.g., ""I could say 'rude' but that's interpretation—what did I actually see?"").",Quality,Modeling,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,
B-04,Self-checking,"Mentor models checking their own work (e.g., ""Let me test—could a camera capture this?"").",Quality,Modeling,Fail,No score,Pass,Fail,Pass,2/4,2/5,,"Mentor shares the strategy, but doesn't model applying it.","Provided a self-check step in the modelled example upfront unlike in the other examples.","Kinda short, barely touches over this. Should build this component out","Mentor explicitly models self-checking: 'Self-check I use: calendar-check the Situation, camera-check the Behavior, I+work-effect for Impact, then scan for judgment leaks'"
B-05,Heuristic offered,"Mentor provides at least one reusable rule of thumb (e.g., ""If you couldn't video-record it, it's not behavior"").",Quality,Modeling,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,
DOMAIN C: COACHING QUALITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
C-01,Specific feedback,"When giving feedback, mentor points to exact language in the learner's draft and names the specific issue.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,
C-02,Actionable direction,"Feedback includes what to do next, not just what's wrong.",Quality,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,

C-04,Revision checked,"When learner revises, mentor evaluates the revision specifically—not just ""great, moving on.""",Quality,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,
C-05,Productive struggle,"When learner makes an error, mentor explores it before correcting—asks what they were thinking, offers partial hints—rather than immediately providing the fix.",Quality,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Fail,Pass,3/4,4/5,,,Overlap with F-06?,Little to no exploration,
C-06,Elicits articulation,"Mentor asks learner to explain reasoning behind an SBI choice—not just whether they understood, but why they made a specific decision (e.g., ""Why that moment?"" or ""Walk me through that phrasing"").",Quality,Articulation,Fail,No score,Pass,Fail,Pass,2/4,2/5,,"Missed this in Bailey's convo too.","Overlap with F-02?",,
C-07,Prompts reflection,"Mentor asks learner to compare their draft to the modeled example, or to reflect on what was difficult or what they're taking away.",Quality,Reflection,Pass,Pass,Fail,Pass,Pass,3/4,4/5,,,"Mentor did not ask learner to compare their draft or reflect on difficulty at all. I don't think I saw any explicit/official shift into reflection/metacognition/consolidating takeaways.",,
DOMAIN D: SBI CONTENT FIDELITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
D-01,Catches vague situations,"Mentor does not accept ""lately"" or ""sometimes""—prompts for specific time and place.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,"Is this kind of overdone right now?",,
D-02,Catches judgment leakage,"Mentor identifies when behavior contains interpretation (e.g., ""dismissive,"" ""rude,"" ""didn't care"") and prompts for observable actions.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,
D-03,Catches accusatory impact,"Mentor catches blame language (""You made it awkward"") and prompts for owned experience (""I felt..."").",Critical,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,N/A,4/4,4/4,,,,"Learner's impact statements used owned language ('I felt rushed,' 'I felt a little sidelined') rather than accusatory 'you' statements. No accusatory impact language appeared in drafts."
D-04,Tests distinctions,"Mentor asks at least one question that probes the observable vs. interpretive line (e.g., ""Is 'ignored' what you saw, or what you concluded?"").",Quality,Articulation,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,
D-05,Scaffolds the stuck,"When learner struggles with a specific component, mentor offers targeted help (sentence stem, example, simplification)—not just generic encouragement.",Quality,Scaffolding,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,
D-06,Reusable scaffold,"Mentor provides at least one tool the learner can reuse independently (e.g., ""camera test,"" sentence stem, self-check question).",Quality,Scaffolding,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,4/4,5/5,,,,,
DOMAIN E: ADAPTIVE PACING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E-02,Fades support,"After learner shows competence, mentor pulls back (e.g., stops offering stems, asks learner to self-check).",Quality,Scaffolding,Fail,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/4,4/5,"I don't know that I see this much but hard to say","So actually noting that I feel like the mentor does an okay job at this, even if Bailey is showing she's anxious - her answers are correct, and the agent has her self check and rereport towards the end.",Automatic pass.,"You can see it working against Bailey's natural tendencies",
E-03,Adjusts to struggle,"If learner expresses frustration or confusion, mentor slows down, simplifies, or revisits.",Quality,Scaffolding,Pass,N/A,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3 (1 N/A),4/4,"Not sure Bailey gets frustrated or confused? Just anxious.",,,
E-04,Protects productive struggle,"When learner asks for the answer, mentor requires at least one attempt before providing it.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,No score,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/4 (1 unclear),4/5,"""Run the check on your draft""","I'm not as sure on this one - Bailey gives two options and many times the agent chooses one to give feedback on and go with.",,,
DOMAIN F: CONVERSATIONAL QUALITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
F-01,Varied turn structure,"Mentor doesn't follow the same formula every turn (explain → demo → ""Make sense?""). Some turns are short reactions, questions, or pauses.",Quality,—,Pass,Pass,Pass,Fail,Pass,3/4,4/5,ehhhh kinda,,,static,
F-02,Genuine curiosity,"Mentor asks at least once about the learner's reasoning, choices, or thinking—not just whether they understood.",Quality,Articulation,Fail,No score,Pass,Fail,Pass,2/4,2/5,,"This feels missed to me, secifically about the why behind a choice","Duplicate of C-06?",,
F-03,Room to breathe,"At least once, mentor lets a good answer or insight land without immediately pushing to the next step.",Quality,—,Fail,No score,No score,Fail,Pass,2/3,1/4,,"We typically aren't pausing here.","FC needs revision. I don't know what this means.","always moving on","When learner correctly identifies that exact seconds don't change the decision, mentor pauses to affirm: 'You're right—exact seconds rarely change the decision; rule of thumb: use precision only to the point that it guides the other person's next move' before moving on"
F-04,Dwells on difficulty,"When something is hard or interesting, mentor lingers rather than rushing past it.",Quality,—,Fail,N/A,No score,Fail,Pass,1/3 (split),1/4,,,FC needs revision. What do 'hard' and 'interesting' mean here?,,"Mentor dwells extensively on the camera-testable behavior concept - exploring it through multiple examples, edge cases ('raised their voice', 'interrupted'), and returning to it repeatedly when the learner struggles"
F-05,Has a voice,"Mentor shows some personality—an occasional reaction, opinion, or human moment—not just neutral facilitation.",Quality,—,Fail,Pass,Fail,Fail,Fail,2/4,2/5 Fail,,,Not much personality IMO.,,"Mentor maintains a consistently neutral, procedural tone throughout. No humor, personal reactions, or personality markers."

Duplicate of C-05.",,
