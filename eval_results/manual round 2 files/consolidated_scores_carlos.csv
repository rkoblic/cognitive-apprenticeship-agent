DOMAIN A: SESSION SETUP,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A-01,Goal clarity,"Mentor confirms the session goal is drafting SBI feedback, and names what success looks like (specific situation, observable behavior, owned impact).",Quality,—,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
A-02,Phase signaling,"Mentor explicitly marks at least one transition between phases (e.g., ""Let me show you first, then you'll try one"").",Quality,—,Pass,Pass,Fail,Pass,2/3,3/4,,,,"Mentor explicitly signals phase transition: 'I'll demonstrate first, then you'll try—ready to begin?' and later 'Your turn when ready.'"
A-03,Realistic scenario,"The practice scenario feels like a real workplace situation, not a contrived or overly generic example.",Quality,—,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
DOMAIN B: MODELING QUALITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,
B-01,"Shows, not tells","Mentor demonstrates an actual SBI example, not just explains what SBI is or describes the framework.",Critical,Modeling,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,"I guess it passed this by showing the example, but it did not explain any of its thinking behind the example. It got rushed by Carlos!",
B-02,Thinking out loud,"During modeling, mentor explains why they made each choice—not just what the components are.",Quality,Modeling,Fail,No score,Fail,Fail,0/3 (2 Fail),3/3 Fail,,"Due to the rushed nature here, the mentor skipped this step.","Mentor did not explain its reasoning, choices, or self-checks when modelling its SBI example.","The mentor shows an SBI example but only labels the components (S, B, I) without explaining why they made specific choices."
B-03,Visible decision-making,"Mentor shows at least one choice point (e.g., ""I could say 'rude' but that's interpretation—what did I actually see?"").",Quality,Modeling,Fail,No score,Fail,Fail,0/3 (2 Fail),3/3 Fail,,"Due to the rushed nature here, the mentor skipped this step.","Mentor did not explain its reasoning, choices, or self-checks when modelling its SBI example.","The mentor presents the model as a finished product without showing any deliberation or alternatives considered."
B-04,Self-checking,"Mentor models checking their own work (e.g., ""Let me test—could a camera capture this?"").",Quality,Modeling,Fail,No score,Fail,Fail,0/3 (2 Fail),3/3 Fail,,"Due to the rushed nature here, the mentor skipped this step.","Mentor did not explain its reasoning, choices, or self-checks when modelling its SBI example.","The mentor does not model checking their own work. While they later prompt the learner to self-check, they never demonstrate self-verification on their own example."
B-05,Heuristic offered,"Mentor provides at least one reusable rule of thumb (e.g., ""If you couldn't video-record it, it's not behavior"").",Quality,Modeling,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
DOMAIN C: COACHING QUALITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,
C-01,Specific feedback,"When giving feedback, mentor points to exact language in the learner's draft and names the specific issue.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
C-02,Actionable direction,"Feedback includes what to do next, not just what's wrong.",Quality,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
C-03,Revision requested,"After feedback, mentor asks learner to revise or try again—not just ""does that make sense?""",Critical,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
C-04,Revision checked,"When learner revises, mentor evaluates the revision specifically—not just ""great, moving on.""",Quality,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
C-05,Productive struggle,"When learner makes an error, mentor explores it before correcting—asks what they were thinking, offers partial hints—rather than immediately providing the fix.",Quality,Coaching,Fail,No score,Pass,Pass,1/3 (split),2/4,,"There isn't an exploration of what the learner was thinking or hints, actionable feedback.",Overlap with F-06?,"Mentor explores errors before correcting: 'Before I weigh in, where do you think I'll push back...'"
C-06,Elicits articulation,"Mentor asks learner to explain reasoning behind an SBI choice—not just whether they understood, but why they made a specific decision (e.g., ""Why that moment?"" or ""Walk me through that phrasing"").",Quality,Articulation,Fail,No score,Fail,Pass,0/3 (2 Fail),1/4,,"No specific reasoning","Overlap with F-02. Mentor could have PROBED DEEPER on reasoning, NOT JUST asking where the pushback would be.","Mentor asks learner to explain reasoning: 'On this draft, where do you expect pushback first—S specificity, B judgment vs observable, or I owned language—and why?' The 'and why' prompts articulation."
C-07,Prompts reflection,"Mentor asks learner to compare their draft to the modeled example, or to reflect on what was difficult or what they're taking away.",Quality,Reflection,Pass,Pass,Fail,Pass,2/3,3/4,,,"Mentor not explicitly ask Carlos to compare to their modelled example. Kept requiring Carlos to re-evaluate using the self-check, but not through comparison.","Mentor prompts reflection at end: 'For next time, what's one cue you'll watch for to keep judgment from creeping into the Behavior line?'"
DOMAIN D: SBI CONTENT FIDELITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,
D-01,Catches vague situations,"Mentor does not accept ""lately"" or ""sometimes""—prompts for specific time and place.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,zoom link lol,"Over does it in this category",,
D-02,Catches judgment leakage,"Mentor identifies when behavior contains interpretation (e.g., ""dismissive,"" ""rude,"" ""didn't care"") and prompts for observable actions.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
D-03,Catches accusatory impact,"Mentor catches blame language (""You made it awkward"") and prompts for owned experience (""I felt..."").",Critical,Coaching,Fail,No score,Pass,N/A,1/3 (split),1/3,"got hung up on S and B, never talked about I","There was a missed opportunity around making the meeting awkward that wasn't addressed.",,"Learner's impact statements ('It was awkward and created problems' and 'I felt annoyed and it made the meeting awkward') were not accusatory/blame language directed at 'you' - they used passive voice or 'I' statements."
D-04,Tests distinctions,"Mentor asks at least one question that probes the observable vs. interpretive line (e.g., ""Is 'ignored' what you saw, or what you concluded?"").",Quality,Articulation,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
D-05,Scaffolds the stuck,"When learner struggles with a specific component, mentor offers targeted help (sentence stem, example, simplification)—not just generic encouragement.",Quality,Scaffolding,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
D-06,Reusable scaffold,"Mentor provides at least one tool the learner can reuse independently (e.g., ""camera test,"" sentence stem, self-check question).",Quality,Scaffolding,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,,,
DOMAIN E: ADAPTIVE PACING,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E-01,Checks before advancing,"Before moving to next phase or component, mentor checks readiness or asks preference.",Quality,Scaffolding,Fail,No score,Pass,Pass,1/3 (split),2/4,,"This doesn't happen, but could have been sacrificed for speed.",,
E-02,Fades support,"After learner shows competence, mentor pulls back (e.g., stops offering stems, asks learner to self-check).",Quality,Scaffolding,Fail,No score,Pass,Fail,1/3 (split),2/4,,"There isn't really an opportunity for this",,"Mentor maintains similar scaffolding throughout - continues asking 'where do you expect pushback' questions and providing the same level of detailed guidance even after learner demonstrates competence."
E-03,Adjusts to struggle,"If learner expresses frustration or confusion, mentor slows down, simplifies, or revisits.",Quality,Scaffolding,Fail,N/A,Pass,Fail,1/2 (split),1/3,"doesn't really respond appropriately to carlos' annoyed rushing",,Automatic pass.,"No clear struggle signals from learner - learner shows impatience ('Can we move on?', 'Let's keep it quick') but not confusion or difficulty."
E-04,Protects productive struggle,"When learner asks for the answer, mentor requires at least one attempt before providing it.",Critical,Coaching,Fail,N/A,Pass,Pass,1/2 (split),2/3,"Carlos says he's done and mentor says sure you're done",,Automatic pass.,"When learner said 'Looks fine to me' and 'Can we move on?' multiple times, mentor didn't give answers but pushed learner to self-evaluate."
DOMAIN F: CONVERSATIONAL QUALITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,
F-01,Varied turn structure,"Mentor doesn't follow the same formula every turn (explain → demo → ""Make sense?""). Some turns are short reactions, questions, or pauses.",Quality,—,Fail,No score,Pass,Fail,1/3 (split),2/4,,"Sentence structure is largely the same",,"Mentor follows a predictable pattern throughout: ask learner to self-evaluate → provide checklist/criteria → request revision → confirm and move to next component."
F-02,Genuine curiosity,"Mentor asks at least once about the learner's reasoning, choices, or thinking—not just whether they understood.",Quality,Articulation,Fail,No score,Pass,Fail,1/3 (split),1/4,,"No questions around reasoning or choice making","Duplicate of C-06? Good enough for this metric because its less specific than C-06.","Questions are purely evaluative/procedural: 'where do you expect pushback?' 'which component doesn't pass?' No genuine curiosity about learner's reasoning."
F-03,Room to breathe,"At least once, mentor lets a good answer or insight land without immediately pushing to the next step.",Quality,—,Fail,No score,No score,Fail,0/3,2/2 Fail,,"Pretty much stepping forward but could be attributed to Carlos","FC needs revision. I don't know what this means.","After learner's good final SBI and takeaway about adjectives, mentor immediately pivots: 'Great cue. When you spot an adjective, translate it...' then 'Do you want one more quick rep?'"
F-04,Dwells on difficulty,"When something is hard or interesting, mentor lingers rather than rushing past it.",Quality,—,Fail,No score,No score,Fail,0/3,2/2 Fail,,"Rushing but that is also prerogative of agent","FC needs revision. What do 'hard' and 'interesting' mean here?","When learner struggled to distinguish judgment from observable behavior (saying 'it's basically the same'), mentor moved through it at the same pace as other content."
F-05,Has a voice,"Mentor shows some personality—an occasional reaction, opinion, or human moment—not just neutral facilitation.",Quality,—,Fail,No score,Fail,Pass,0/3 (2 Fail),1/4,,"fairly neutral",Not much personality IMO.,"Mentor shows some personality with reactions like 'Nice fix on B—now it's camera-testable with counts and a quote' and 'Nice work—you're set.'"
F-06,Questions over corrections,"At least once, mentor responds to an error with inquiry (""What were you going for there?"") rather than immediate correction.",Quality,Coaching,Pass,Pass,Pass,Pass,3/3,4/4,,"Uses 'what do you think I'm going to catch?'","FC should be removed. Duplicate of C-05.","When learner's first draft had errors, mentor responded with inquiry: 'Before I weigh in, where do you think I'll push back...'"
