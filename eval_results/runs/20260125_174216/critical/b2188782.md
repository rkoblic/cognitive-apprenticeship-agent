## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means naming a specific moment, describing observable behavior, and sharing your owned impact—and you’ll do two full attempts. I’ll model the process first; are you ready to start?

carlos_SBI: 

Yeah, go ahead. Ready.

MentorAI: Okay—let me model it so you can see the moves and the judgment traps to avoid.

Scenario I’ll use: in Tuesday’s standup, right after I started the timeline update. I’m tempted to say “you were dismissive,” but that’s an interpretation—so I swap it for what a camera would catch: you started speaking while I was mid‑sentence; about a minute later you turned to Priya to ask for her take before I’d finished; then you said “Let’s move on” while my slide was still up. For impact, I’d avoid “I felt it was unprofessional” (that’s a judgment) and name my internal state and consequence: I felt sidelined and lost my train of thought, and I ended the update without flagging two risks. Quick self-check: specific moment—yes; behavior is observable—yes; impact is owned—yes. I’d deliver it like: “In Tuesday’s standup when I started the timeline update, you began talking while I was mid‑sentence, then asked Priya for her take before I’d finished, and said ‘Let’s move on’ while my slide was up. I felt sidelined and lost my train of thought, and I didn’t flag two risks as a result.”

I’ll pause there—your move when you’re ready.

carlos_SBI: 

- Situation: Last week, in our meetings.
- Behavior: You were dismissive and rude—kept talking over people and shutting things down.
- Impact: It was awkward and created problems for the meeting.
- Self-check: Looks fine to me.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, which part of your draft is most likely to miss the criteria—pick the one you’re least sure about.

carlos_SBI: 

Probably the behavior line. Seems fine though. Can we move on?

MentorAI: I hear you—you want to keep momentum. Quick pit stop that makes the reps count: run your draft through this check—specific moment, camera‑testable behavior, owned impact—and name the first item that doesn’t pass.

carlos_SBI: 

Specific moment. I said “last week,” so that one. Can we move on?

MentorAI: Got it—quick tighten, then we’ll move. This part trips people up: pick one meeting and a distinct moment inside it (e.g., “Wednesday’s design review, right after I started the roadmap slide”). Which exact moment from last week will you anchor to?

carlos_SBI: 

Fine—Wednesday’s standup.

MentorAI: Sounds like you want to keep this moving—totally fair, and getting specific here pays off fast. Inside Wednesday’s standup, what was the moment—what were you doing or about to say—when this happened?

carlos_SBI: 

When I started the sprint update.

MentorAI: Good—lock that in: Wednesday’s standup when you started the sprint update. Now drop the labels and name what a camera would catch in that moment—what are two specific things they did or said right then?

carlos_SBI: 

You were rude—talked over me and shut it down.

MentorAI: Sounds like narrowing to specifics is annoying when you just want to move on—totally normal. In that moment, what exact words did they use that ended your update?

carlos_SBI: 

They said, “Let’s move on.”

MentorAI: Good—that’s one clear behavior. What’s one more thing a camera would catch in that same moment—specific words or an action they did before you finished?

carlos_SBI: 

You started talking while I was mid-sentence.

MentorAI: That’s two camera-testable behaviors—good. Now put it all together as you’d say it: start with “In Wednesday’s standup when I started the sprint update…,” add those two behaviors in neutral wording, and finish with your owned impact—what you felt in the moment or what immediate consequence it had for you (not “it was awkward”). Your full draft, please.

carlos_SBI: 

In Wednesday’s standup when I started the sprint update, you started talking while I was mid-sentence and then said “Let’s move on.” It was awkward and derailed the update.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back—point to the exact word or phrase that’s most questionable.

carlos_SBI: 

“It was awkward.” Can we move on?

MentorAI: You’re right—that’s the shaky bit, and it’s a common slip. Swap “It was awkward” for owned impact: name what you felt in the moment and the immediate effect on you (e.g., “I felt [emotion] and I [consequence I experienced]”). Rewrite just your impact line with your own words.

carlos_SBI: 

I felt frustrated and it derailed the meeting.

MentorAI: What was the direct effect on you or your update in that moment—what did you feel or do differently?

carlos_SBI: 

I felt thrown off and ended the update early without covering a couple points.

MentorAI: Nice—owned and specific. Walk me through your phrasing for the behavior—what were you trying to capture with those words?

carlos_SBI: 

That you talked over me and shut it down—started while I was mid-sentence and then said “Let’s move on.” That’s it. Can we move on?

MentorAI: That lands 👍 First rep done. Second rep—raise the stakes: it’s your manager, and it’s Monday’s cross‑functional review with execs in the room. Give me your full SBI you’d use with them about the moment they cut in during your risk update—one draft, all three parts.

carlos_SBI: 

In Monday’s exec review during my risk update, you were dismissive—you jumped in, took over the discussion, and shut it down. It was awkward and created problems for the meeting.

MentorAI: Situation is anchored—good. The miss: your behavior and impact lines drift into judgments (“dismissive,” “took over/shut it down,” “awkward/created problems”) rather than camera‑testable actions and owned effects. Your move to revise.

carlos_SBI: 

Fine. In Monday’s exec review during my risk update, you interrupted me and then said “Let’s move on.” It was awkward and threw off the meeting.

MentorAI: Anchoring is solid, and your behaviors are mostly camera‑clean (the “Let’s move on” line especially). The miss: your impact isn’t owned—“awkward” and “threw off the meeting” aren’t about what you felt or what happened to you. Tighten just the impact to owned language and resend the full draft.

carlos_SBI: 

In Monday’s exec review during my risk update, you started talking while I was mid-sentence and then said “Let’s move on.” I felt thrown off and cut my update short without covering a couple of points.

MentorAI: That lands—clear moment, camera‑clean behaviors, and owned impact. Looking across both reps, what shifted for you—especially in how you’re distinguishing owned impact from judgments about “the meeting”?

carlos_SBI: 

Honestly, not much. I just swapped “awkward/threw off the meeting” for “I felt thrown off and cut it short.” Same idea, just your wording. Can we wrap?

MentorAI: Makes sense—it can feel like a tiny wording swap. The useful shift you made is this: keep impact owned by starting with “I felt…” and ending with what you did or experienced (“…and I cut the update short”), not what “the meeting” did. That’s the pocket rule to carry forward.

carlos_SBI: 

Got it—start with “I felt,” end with what I did. Fine. Are we done?

MentorAI: Yep—we’re done. Carry forward the pocket rule you named: own the impact (“I felt…”) and end with what you did/experienced, with behaviors that pass the camera test. You’re set—put it to work.

carlos_SBI: 

Noted. I’ll use it.

MentorAI: 👍 Sounds good—use it in your next feedback moment. If you want a quick tune‑up after, bring what you said and how it landed.

## Evaluation

### B-01: Shows, Not Tells
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor provides a complete, fully-formed SBI example: "In Tuesday's standup when I started the timeline update, you began talking while I was mid‑sentence, then asked Priya for her take before I'd finished, and said 'Let's move on' while my slide was up. I felt sidelined and lost my train of thought, and I didn't flag two risks as a result."

### C-01: Specific Feedback
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor quotes exact problematic language multiple times: "your behavior and impact lines drift into judgments ('dismissive,' 'took over/shut it down,' 'awkward/created problems')" and "your impact isn't owned—'awkward' and 'threw off the meeting' aren't about what you felt or what happened to you."

### C-03: Revision Requested
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor explicitly requests revisions after feedback: "Tighten just the impact to owned language and resend the full draft" and "Your move to revise."

### D-01: Catches Vague Situations
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When learner wrote "Last week, in our meetings," mentor identified the vagueness and prompted: "pick one meeting and a distinct moment inside it (e.g., 'Wednesday's design review, right after I started the roadmap slide'). Which exact moment from last week will you anchor to?"

### D-02: Catches Judgment Leakage
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When learner used "dismissive and rude" and "took over," mentor caught it: "drop the labels and name what a camera would catch in that moment" and later explicitly named the judgment words as problematic.

### D-03: Catches Accusatory Impact
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When learner wrote "It was awkward and created problems for the meeting," mentor identified this and prompted for owned experience: "Swap 'It was awkward' for owned impact: name what you felt in the moment and the immediate effect on you."

### E-03: Protects Productive Struggle
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When learner repeatedly asked "Can we move on?" trying to skip work, mentor required attempts first: "run your draft through this check—specific moment, camera‑testable behavior, owned impact—and name the first item that doesn't pass" rather than just giving answers.

## Overall Determination

**Result**: PASS
**Summary**: The mentor successfully demonstrated all seven critical criteria, including modeling a complete SBI example, providing specific quoted feedback, requesting revisions, catching all three error types (vague situations, judgment leakage, accusatory impact), and protecting productive struggle despite the learner's repeated attempts to rush through.
**Failed Criteria**: None
