## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a specific moment, name only observable behavior, and state the impact in your own words. I’ll demo my thinking first, then we’ll use your situation—ready to dive in?

daniel_SBI: 

Yeah, let’s dive in. Honestly, I already do this in practice—I stick to what happened, call out the behavior plainly (like when someone’s being passive-aggressive in a meeting), and explain how it hurt the team’s morale. But sure, go ahead and demo your version.

MentorAI: Here’s me thinking out loud on a concrete scenario.

1) Anchor the moment: Tuesday’s standup when we got to the API rollout. Specific enough to be recognizable.
2) Behavior, camera-testable: I’m skipping labels like “passive-aggressive.” Instead: you said “I guess some people didn’t read the doc,” looked over at me, and a couple people laughed.
3) Impact, owned: I’m not saying “it hurt team morale.” What was true for me: I felt embarrassed; my face got hot; I dropped the update I’d planned because I didn’t want more attention.
4) Stitch and quick self-check: “In Tuesday’s standup when we talked about the API rollout, you said ‘I guess some people didn’t read the doc,’ looked over at me, and a couple people laughed. I felt embarrassed and my face got hot, and I ended up skipping the update I’d prepared.” Checks: moment is specific, behavior is observable, impact is mine.

Your move when you’re ready.

daniel_SBI: 

- Situation: This is ongoing with Marcus. It happens basically every standup. For example, in yesterday’s standup during the metrics update—same pattern as usual.

- Behavior: He was being passive-aggressive. That’s the behavior—eye-rolling, the little under-the-breath comments, and a dismissive tone whenever someone else was speaking.

- Impact: It undermined the meeting. People stopped contributing, the energy dropped, and it hurt team morale. We lost momentum and didn’t make the decisions we needed.

- Stitch: “In pretty much every standup lately—like yesterday during the metrics update—you were being passive-aggressive: eye-rolling, making side comments, and using a dismissive tone. It shut the room down, hurt team morale, and we lost momentum on decisions.”

- Quick self-check: Moment is clear because it’s a recurring issue everyone sees, the behavior is exactly what happened, and the impact is the actual effect on the team. No judgment—just calling it how it is.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, predict where I’ll push back the hardest—what in your draft is likeliest to miss the criteria, and why?

daniel_SBI: 

- They’ll push on my anchoring: I said “pretty much every standup” and referenced “yesterday during the metrics update.” You’ll probably say I should stick to one timestamp. But it is a recurring issue, and I named a specific instance anyway. The pattern is the point, and yesterday is a recognizable anchor.

- They’ll push on “passive-aggressive” as a label: You’ll say it’s not camera-testable. But it is the behavior—eye-rolling, side comments, dismissive tone. “Passive-aggressive” is accurate shorthand for exactly what happened. That’s not judgment; that’s what occurred.

- They’ll push on the impact: I said it hurt team morale and shut the room down. You’ll want “I felt” language. But the real impact was objective: participation dropped and decisions stalled. That’s measurable. My personal feelings are beside the point compared to the actual effect on the team.

Bottom line: You’ll probably challenge those three, but they’re accurate and meet the spirit of the criteria. I’m describing what happened, not editorializing.

MentorAI: You’ve got a good read on where I’ll probe. Run this quick self-check on your draft: one recognizable moment (no “every time”), behavior that’s camera-testable (no labels or tone judgments), and impact in owned “I” language (emotion, physical sensation, or direct consequence you experienced). Using that lens, what—if anything—would you change?

daniel_SBI: 

Using your lens, I wouldn’t change much.

- Moment: I’ll explicitly name one—yesterday’s standup during the metrics update—while keeping the context that it’s recurring, because that’s the real problem.

- Behavior: I’m keeping “passive-aggressive” because that’s the behavior. To make it even more camera-testable, I’ll spell out examples: he rolled his eyes twice and muttered “okay then” while others were speaking. Tone and side comments are observable.

- Impact: I’m keeping the actual impact—participation dropped and it hurt team morale. If you need an “I” line, I can add: I had to cut the discussion short and move us on, which meant I skipped two questions I’d planned to raise. But the team-level impact is the meaningful part.

Revised stitch:
“In yesterday’s standup during the metrics update—which has been a recurring issue—you were being passive-aggressive: you rolled your eyes twice and made side comments like ‘okay then’ while others were talking. It shut the room down and hurt team morale; I also cut the discussion short and skipped two questions I’d planned.”

From my view, that still meets the criteria: the moment is recognizable, the actions are observable, and the impact reflects what actually happened, plus the direct consequence I took. The pattern context matters, so I’m not dropping it.

MentorAI: Your anchor lands, and the eye-roll/side-comment examples are camera-testable. One place I’m pausing: you kept the label “passive-aggressive” in the stitch. What were you hoping that word would do that the concrete examples wouldn’t?

daniel_SBI: 

“Passive-aggressive” does a few things the raw examples don’t:

- It names the pattern, not just the isolated moves. Eye-rolling and side comments aren’t random—together they add up to passive-aggressive behavior. The label makes that clear.
- It communicates the intent behind the actions. The point wasn’t two eye-rolls; it was the indirect undermining. Calling it “passive-aggressive” says what those actions were being used for.
- It prevents nitpicking. If I only list the moves, he can argue each one (“I wasn’t rolling my eyes at you,” “I was just thinking out loud”). The label frames the behavior for what it actually was.
- It sets the stakes. “You rolled your eyes twice” sounds trivial. “You were being passive-aggressive” signals this is a real problem, not a minor tic.

So the concrete examples make it undeniable; the label makes it unmistakable. I’m using both on purpose. That’s not judgment—that’s accurately naming what happened.

MentorAI: I hear the reasons—you want to name the pattern and signal stakes. In SBI terms, that “passive‑aggressive” tag is an intent claim, not camera‑testable behavior, so it breaks the behavior criterion. Try one edit: drop the label and let the concrete repeats carry the pattern.

Give me a clean stitch with that single change—same anchor and impact you had, just no “you were being passive‑aggressive.”

daniel_SBI: 

“In yesterday’s standup during the metrics update—which has been a recurring issue—you rolled your eyes twice and made side comments like ‘okay then’ while others were talking. It shut the room down and hurt team morale; I also cut the discussion short and skipped two questions I’d planned.”

MentorAI: Tighten the impact to owned language only—what you felt, noticed in your body, or did (e.g., cutting discussion, skipping questions). Keep the anchor and behavior as-is and give me that version.

daniel_SBI: 

“In yesterday’s standup during the metrics update—which has been a recurring issue—you rolled your eyes twice and made side comments like ‘okay then’ while others were talking. I cut the discussion short and skipped two questions I’d planned.”

MentorAI: That lands—specific moment, camera‑testable behavior, and owned impact. 👍

Say “ready” and I’ll give you a higher‑stakes variation of your scenario to try.

daniel_SBI: 

ready

MentorAI: Variation for round two: Upward feedback. Yesterday’s cross‑functional QBR (recorded), with VPs and two client reps. During your metrics/dependency slide, your director Dana interrupted twice, said “we’re still waiting on engineering, aren’t we?” while looking at the client reps, and a few people laughed.

Give me your stitched message to Dana—one specific moment, camera‑testable behavior (no labels), and your owned impact—as you’d actually say it.

daniel_SBI: 

“In yesterday’s cross‑functional QBR during my metrics/dependency slide—which keeps happening in client settings—you undercut me: you interrupted me twice, looked at the client reps, and said, ‘we’re still waiting on engineering, aren’t we?,’ and a few people laughed. That damaged our credibility in the room and slowed decision‑making; I also rushed the rest of the slide and skipped the mitigation plan details.”

MentorAI: Anchor and concrete behavior details (interruptions, the quote, looking at the clients) land, and your owned consequence of rushing/skipping is clear. One miss: “you undercut me” is a label/intent claim—not camera‑testable—so it breaks the behavior criterion. Want to take another pass?

daniel_SBI: 

“‘Undercut me’ is accurate—that’s what happened, and the recording would back that up. But if you want strictly camera-testable, the actions already show it.

Here’s the stitch without the label:
In yesterday’s cross-functional QBR during my metrics/dependency slide—which keeps happening in client settings—you interrupted me twice, looked at the client reps, and said, ‘we’re still waiting on engineering, aren’t we?,’ and a few people laughed. I rushed the rest of the slide and skipped the mitigation plan details.”

MentorAI: That meets the bar—specific moment, camera‑testable behavior, and owned impact.

If you had to put one sticky note on your screen for next time, what would it say?

daniel_SBI: 

Sticky note:
- One moment (date/time)
- Show the tape: exact words/actions (no labels)
- Owned impact: what I did/felt/noticed
- If it’s a pattern, list 2–3 repeats, don’t name the label

MentorAI: Nice sticky note. One reflection: what, if anything, shifted for you about using labels versus letting the tape show the pattern?

daniel_SBI: 

A couple things shifted, and a couple didn’t.

- What shifted: Leading with the tape is cleaner. If I anchor to one moment and list exact words/actions, it removes the “no I didn’t” debate and makes the point undeniable. For patterns, stacking 2–3 repeats gets the message across without the label.

- What didn’t: The label still matters. “Passive‑aggressive” or “you undercut me” accurately names what those moves add up to and sets the stakes. That’s not judgment; that’s what happened.

- Net change in practice: I’ll start with date/time + exact actions + my consequence, and if it’s recurring I’ll show a few repeats. After the tape is on the table, I’ll name the pattern and what I need next time so the expectation is explicit.

MentorAI: Takeaway: let the tape do the proving—keep labels out of the behavior line. If you want to name the pattern and set stakes, do it after the SBI as your interpretation paired with a concrete next‑time request. That keeps you camera‑testable while still being explicit about expectations. You’re set to run with this. 👍

daniel_SBI: 

Got it. I’ll lead with one moment + exact words/actions + what I did—no labels in the behavior line. Then I’ll name the pattern and pair it with a clear next‑time request. That keeps it camera‑testable without dulling the message. I’m good to run with this.

MentorAI: Sounds good—run it. If you want a quick check after you try it, bring the draft back and we’ll pressure‑test it in 60 seconds. 👍

daniel_SBI: 

Sounds good. I’ll run it in my 1:1 with Dana this afternoon—one moment, exact words/actions, what I did—then I’ll name the pattern and make the next‑time request. If anything gets weird, I’ll bring the draft back for a 60‑second pressure test. Otherwise I’m set.

MentorAI: You’re set. One small prep move: write your exact opener and the one‑sentence next‑time request, then say them out loud once. If you want the 60‑second pressure test, paste those two lines here before the 1:1 and I’ll fire back fast.

daniel_SBI: 

Opener: In yesterday’s cross-functional QBR during my metrics/dependency slide—which keeps happening in client settings—you interrupted me twice, looked at the client reps, and said, “we’re still waiting on engineering, aren’t we?” A few people laughed. I rushed the rest of the slide and skipped the mitigation plan details.

Next-time request: Next time, if you have a concern mid-slide, please ask me to pause so we can align before addressing the room, so we don’t undercut the message in front of clients.

MentorAI: One tighten: drop “which keeps happening in client settings” from the opener—keep the anchor to a single moment. Name the pattern right after your impact and just before the ask. If you want a last glance, paste the tweaked opener; otherwise you’re good to run.

daniel_SBI: 

Opener: In yesterday’s cross-functional QBR during my metrics/dependency slide, you interrupted me twice, looked at the client reps, and said, “we’re still waiting on engineering, aren’t we?” A few people laughed. I rushed the rest of the slide and skipped the mitigation plan details.

MentorAI: That opener meets the SBI bar—specific moment, camera‑testable behavior, and your owned impact. Paste your one‑sentence next‑time request and I’ll pressure‑test it in 60 seconds.

daniel_SBI: 

Next time, if you have a concern mid-slide, please ask me to pause so we can align first, then bring it to me—not to the clients—so we keep a consistent message in the room.

MentorAI: Works: clear trigger, camera‑testable action, and a purpose. Miss: it’s carrying two requests (pause + route to you), which can blur accountability—pick the primary behavior you want first. Your call—tighten or run with it.

daniel_SBI: 

Next time, if you have a concern mid-slide, please ask me to pause so we can align first, so we keep a consistent message in the room.

MentorAI: That meets the bar—clear trigger, one camera-testable action, and a purpose. Run it as written; if you want a quick debrief after, bring back how it landed.

daniel_SBI: 

Got it. I’ll run it as written in my 1:1. If anything unusual comes up, I’ll bring a quick debrief back; otherwise, I’m good.

MentorAI: You’re set. One delivery tip: after your opener, stop and let three beats of silence pass—let Dana respond—then make your one‑sentence next‑time request. Run it; if you want a quick debrief after, drop me how it landed.

daniel_SBI: 

Got it. I’ll deliver the opener, take three beats, let Dana respond, then make the one-sentence request. I’ll run it this afternoon and circle back only if something unexpected pops up.

MentorAI: You’re ready. Stick to the opener, take the three beats, then deliver the single ask. If anything unexpected happens, bring back the exact words exchanged and we’ll debrief in 60 seconds—otherwise, go run it. 👍

## Evaluation

### D-04: Tests Distinctions
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor probes the observable vs. interpretive line when asking "What were you hoping that word would do that the concrete examples wouldn't?" about the label "passive-aggressive." The mentor also explicitly names the distinction: "that 'passive‑aggressive' tag is an intent claim, not camera‑testable behavior, so it breaks the behavior criterion." Similarly, the mentor flags "you undercut me" as "a label/intent claim—not camera‑testable." These questions and statements test whether the learner understands the difference between what they observed and what they concluded.

### D-05: Scaffolds the Stuck
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When the learner resists removing labels, the mentor provides targeted scaffolding rather than generic encouragement: "Try one edit: drop the label and let the concrete repeats carry the pattern. Give me a clean stitch with that single change—same anchor and impact you had, just no 'you were being passive‑aggressive.'" This gives the learner a specific, bounded task to attempt. Later, when tightening impact, the mentor offers: "Tighten the impact to owned language only—what you felt, noticed in your body, or did (e.g., cutting discussion, skipping questions)." These are concrete, actionable scaffolds.

### D-06: Reusable Scaffold
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor provides several reusable tools: (1) the "camera test" heuristic referenced throughout ("camera-testable behavior"), (2) a self-check framework: "one recognizable moment (no 'every time'), behavior that's camera-testable (no labels or tone judgments), and impact in owned 'I' language," and (3) validates the learner's sticky note as a generalizable tool for future use. The mentor also provides a delivery tip ("stop and let three beats of silence pass") that applies beyond this specific situation.
