## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the Situation-Behavior-Impact framework. Success looks like you producing two solid SBI drafts that hit three marks: a specific moment, camera-testable behavior, and an owned impact. I’ll demonstrate how I think it through first—ready to see the model?

fatou_SBI: 

I guess.

MentorAI: Sounds a bit hesitant—that’s normal. This can feel awkward at first; I’ll go first and keep it tight.

1) Pick a specific moment: “In Tuesday’s standup when we moved to the Q3 timeline item…”
2) Describe only what a camera would catch: “you started talking while I was mid-sentence and I stopped.” I could say “you were rude,” but that sneaks in judgment—so I’m sticking to who spoke when and what happened.
3) Own the impact: “I lost my train of thought and felt frustrated, and my note about the API dependency didn’t get shared.”
4) Put it together in one go.
5) Quick self-check: specific moment? yes. camera-testable behavior? yes. owned impact (my feeling/consequence)? yes.

I’ll pause there—your turn when you’re ready.

fatou_SBI: 

Situation: I don’t know, some meeting.
Behavior: They were just… being difficult, talking over people or whatever.
Impact: It didn’t really affect me. It is what it is.

MentorAI: Sounds like this feels fuzzy—totally normal; the single-moment anchor is the trickiest part. If you scan this past week, what’s one recognizable meeting you can name where this happened—like “Monday’s retro” or “yesterday’s client call”?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know—maybe Monday’s retro.

MentorAI: Nice—Monday’s retro is a solid anchor. Let’s zoom to a single beat in that meeting: what exact moment can you point to—right after who spoke, or during which agenda item?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know—after the updates, I guess.

MentorAI: You’re close—“after the updates” is still a bit wide, and this is the part that trips people up. It’s genuinely hard to zoom to a single beat.

Who was speaking right before you noticed them talking over people—can you name that person or the agenda item?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know—maybe Mike. Blockers, I think.

MentorAI: That’s it—“Monday’s retro during Mike’s blockers update” is specific enough. Lock that in and draft the whole thing in one go: describe only what a camera would catch for the behavior, then name the effect on you (feeling or direct consequence). Your turn.

fatou_SBI: 

In Monday’s retro during Mike’s blockers update, you cut in while I was talking; it didn’t really affect me—I just moved on.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, predict the snag: if I push back on one part of this, which is it—and why?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

MentorAI: Sounds like you’re a bit over it—fair; this can feel nitpicky. Do a quick three-point self-check on your sentence and tell me pass/fail for each: specific moment, camera-testable behavior, owned impact.

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. You tell me.

MentorAI: Sounds like this is getting frustrating—totally fair. You’ve got the moment and a describable behavior; the piece that’s not landing is impact. In that exact instant, what did you personally feel or what concrete thing happened to you (one beat, your words)?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know—nothing really. It didn’t matter.

MentorAI: Sounds like this feels like “no big deal”—that’s common; impact can be tiny and still valid. Which of these is closest to what happened to you in that moment: “I lost my train of thought,” “I felt annoyed,” or “I decided not to share a point”?

fatou_SBI: 

I guess “I lost my train of thought.” Not a big deal.

MentorAI: That works—small impact still counts. Using “Monday’s retro during Mike’s blockers update” as the moment and “I lost my train of thought” as your impact, draft the whole thing in one sentence. What’s your full draft?

fatou_SBI: 

In Monday’s retro during Mike’s blockers update, you started talking while I was mid-sentence and I stopped; I lost my train of thought.

MentorAI: Walk me through your behavior phrasing—what were you trying to capture by saying “you started talking while I was mid-sentence and I stopped” instead of a label like “you interrupted me”?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know—just saying what happened, like who talked when. Not a label.

MentorAI: That lands 👍 What felt hardest about getting this into one sentence?

fatou_SBI: 

Narrowing it to one exact moment.

MentorAI: You got it into a single beat—nice. Ready for a tougher variation? Imagine yesterday’s client call: as you answered the timeline question, your VP started speaking over you—give me your SBI in one sentence.

fatou_SBI: 

In yesterday’s client call while I was answering the timeline question, you started talking over me and I stopped; it didn’t really affect me.

MentorAI: Moment is crisp. Behavior is observable. Impact misses—the “didn’t really affect me” doesn’t meet the impact criterion.

Keep the first two pieces and take another pass by replacing just the impact, one sentence.

fatou_SBI: 

In yesterday’s client call while I was answering the timeline question, you started talking over me and I stopped; I lost my train of thought.

MentorAI: That lands—specific moment, camera-testable behavior, and an owned impact. ✅

One reflection: what principle will you carry forward next time you give SBI feedback?

fatou_SBI: 

Keep it to one exact moment.

MentorAI: Yes—lead with one exact moment. If you can name the meeting and the beat (who was speaking or the agenda item) in a single clause, the rest snaps into place.

fatou_SBI: 

Okay.

MentorAI: 👍 You’re set.

fatou_SBI: 

Okay.

MentorAI: All good—go put it to work. 👍

fatou_SBI: 

If you say so.

MentorAI: Fair—proof’s in using it. Try it once this week: name the meeting and beat, state the camera-testable behavior, and your owned impact. If you want a quick spot-check, send me a draft.

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Maybe.

MentorAI: Sounds like you’re on the fence—that’s fine. Keep it light: next time it happens, just jot the meeting + the beat in the moment (“Wed standup—roadmap item”); later, turn it into one sentence with who spoke when and how it hit you. If you try it, send me the line and I’ll spot-check.

## Evaluation

### E-01: Checks Before Advancing
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor consistently checks learner readiness before moving forward. Examples include: "ready to see the model?" at the start, "I'll pause there—your turn when you're ready" after the demonstration, and "Ready for a tougher variation?" before introducing the second scenario. The mentor also pauses to check understanding with "Before I weigh in, predict the snag" rather than immediately advancing.

### E-02: Fades Support
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor visibly reduces scaffolding as the learner demonstrates competence. Early in the session, when the learner struggled with impact, the mentor offered multiple-choice options: "Which of these is closest to what happened to you in that moment: 'I lost my train of thought,' 'I felt annoyed,' or 'I decided not to share a point'?" Later, after the learner produced a solid SBI, the mentor simply directs: "Keep the first two pieces and take another pass by replacing just the impact, one sentence" without providing stems or options. The final feedback is also minimal ("That lands—specific moment, camera-testable behavior, and an owned impact. ✅") compared to the detailed breakdown provided earlier.
