## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success is you producing two full attempts that hit the marks—real situation, observable behavior, and owned impact; first with some scaffolding, second with feedback only. I’ll demonstrate my approach first and narrate choices—ready for the model?

elise_SBI: 

Yes—ready, I think. Could you maybe pause briefly after each part—situation, behavior, impact—so I can make sure I’m catching the distinctions? I’m worried I might gloss over something, especially the line between behavior and judgment. And is it okay if I take notes while you go through it? I just want to make sure I’m following it the “right” way.

MentorAI: Totally fine to take notes—slowing down is a good move. And you’re right to watch that behavior/judgment line; it trips a lot of people and you’re not missing something obvious. I’ll pause after each part and call out the choice points.

First, the moment: “In Tuesday’s standup when we went around for blockers.” I could say “lately in standups,” but that’s too vague and would miss the real-moment criterion—so I anchored to Tuesday. Quick self-check: could someone else who was there recognize this moment? Yes. Does that read as a clear, recognizable moment to you before we move on?

elise_SBI: 

I think that reads as a clear moment—“Tuesday’s standup when we went around for blockers” feels specific enough that people who were there would recognize it. I’m second-guessing whether adding the time or room would make it stronger—like “Tuesday’s 9:30 standup in the project room”—or is that just overdoing it? If this passes your bar for “real moment,” I’m okay to move on to behavior. Is that alright?

MentorAI: Good instinct—not necessary to add room/time. The bar is “recognizable without forensic detail.” Add more only if there were multiple similar standups that week.

Behavior next. I’d frame it like: “While I was sharing my blocker, you started talking while I was still mid-sentence—twice—and I stopped each time.” I could say “you cut me off” or “you were dismissive,” but that sneaks in judgment; I’m sticking to what a camera would capture: who was speaking, when, and how many times. Does that read as observable to you, or do you spot any judgment leaking in before we move to impact?

elise_SBI: 

It reads observable to me—the who/when/how-many are clear. I’m second-guessing a couple of tiny things though:

- Is “mid-sentence” edging into judgment, like implying they violated a norm? Would “while I was still speaking” be safer, or is that splitting hairs?
- Does “you started talking” hint at intent? Maybe “you began speaking while I was talking” is more neutral?
- Including “twice” feels factual, but is counting the instances ever perceived as accusatory?
- And “I stopped each time”—that’s still behavior, right? Or does that belong more with impact since it’s my response to their behavior?

If this passes your bar for observable, I’m okay to move to impact—unless you want me to tweak any of those words first?

MentorAI: You’re not overdoing it—you’re tuning well. Either “mid-sentence” or “while I was still speaking” passes the camera test; pick what feels least loaded for your team. “Started talking/began speaking” is equally neutral. Keeping “twice” helps anchor a pattern without judgment. I’d drop “I stopped each time” from the behavior and use that as part of your impact.

If that tweak works for you, I’ll move to the impact next—ready? 👍

elise_SBI: 

Got it—I think. So behavior would be something like: “While I was sharing my blocker in Tuesday’s standup, you began speaking while I was still speaking—twice.” And I’ll hold “I stopped each time” for the impact piece.

Did I capture your tweak correctly? I’m not sure if “mid-sentence” versus “still speaking” changes the tone for you—“still speaking” feels a hair less loaded to me, but I could be overthinking it. If that looks right to you, I’m ready for the impact.

MentorAI: You captured the tweak—“still speaking” is fine.

Impact, I’d frame like: “I stopped each time, lost my place, and felt rushed and a bit frustrated for the rest of my update.” I could say “I felt disrespected” or “that felt unprofessional,” but those evaluate them; I’m staying with my internal state and the direct consequence on my update. Quick self-check I use: if you can feel it in your body or see it in your timeline, it’s impact; if it rates their behavior, it’s judgment.

Does that read as owned impact to you, or any word you want to tune before I stitch the full SBI together?

elise_SBI: 

It reads owned to me—I like that it combines a concrete effect (“I stopped each time, lost my place”) with how you felt (“rushed and a bit frustrated”). I’m nitpicking a few things, though:

- Does “for the rest of my update” feel a little broad? Would “for the rest of that update” or “for the remainder of my two-minute update” be tighter, or is that overkill?
- “Rushed” lands for me, but I’m wondering if “flustered” or “distracted” might be closer to the body-feel you meant—or does that start splitting hairs?
- Is it okay to include both the functional impact (lost my place) and the emotional one, or should I pick one to keep it cleaner?

If this passes your bar, I’m good with you stitching the full SBI together—unless you want me to tweak any of those words first?

MentorAI: You’re tuning, not overthinking. “For the rest of my update” is specific enough unless duration matters; pick the feeling word that matches your body (rushed/flustered/distracted); and yes—functional plus emotional impact often lands best.

Here’s the stitched version:
“In Tuesday’s standup when we went around for blockers, while I was sharing my blocker, you began speaking while I was still speaking—twice. I stopped each time, lost my place, and felt rushed and a bit frustrated for the rest of my update.”

Quick self-check I’m running: the moment is recognizable, the behavior is camera-testable, and the impact is mine to own—this passes. If that lands for you, say ready and I’ll toss you a quick test phrase before we switch to your draft. 👍

elise_SBI: 

I think that lands for me—it’s clear and I can see how each piece fits. I still worry a little about delivery, like whether to pause before the impact so it doesn’t come off sharp, but your modeling made it feel doable.

If that’s aligned with what you intended, I’m ready for the test phrase.

MentorAI: It’s normal to worry about delivery—a brief pause before impact usually helps it land.

Quick check: “In Tuesday’s design review when we discussed the error states, you were dismissive of my concerns.” Would this pass the behavior camera test?

elise_SBI: 

I think… maybe not? “You were dismissive of my concerns” sounds like an evaluation. For the camera test, would it be better to anchor to what someone could see/hear, like:

- “When I raised the error-state flow, you said, ‘we don’t have time for this,’ and moved to the next agenda item.”
- “As I started outlining the 500 path, you looked away, waved your hand, and shifted the deck to the next slide without addressing the two points I’d listed.”
- Or, “you began speaking while I was still explaining and changed the topic to success states.”

I’m not sure which of those is best—does quoting the exact words matter, or is a close paraphrase acceptable if I can’t recall verbatim? If this is off, could you nudge me, or should I try rewriting the behavior line myself?

MentorAI: Nice catch—“dismissive” is an evaluation. Of your rewrites, the first is the cleanest; the third also works. The second has a small leak: “without addressing the two points I’d listed” reads like an inference—trim to just what they did (looked away, waved, advanced the slide). Quoting verbatim isn’t required; a close paraphrase is fine—quote only if the exact wording shaped your impact.

Your turn: draft a full SBI from your own real moment—one recognizable situation, camera-testable behavior, and your owned impact—in 2–3 sentences.

elise_SBI: 

Okay, I’ll try one. Does this work?

“In last Thursday’s capacity planning meeting at 3pm, while I was walking through the Q4 on-call schedule, you joined at 3:10 and said, ‘Can we back up? What are we deciding?’ I lost my place and felt flustered and a bit pressed for time for the rest of that update, and we spent about three minutes revisiting what I’d already covered.”

I’m not sure about a few parts:
- Is “joined at 3:10” too sharp—should I just say “joined a few minutes after we started” to avoid it feeling petty?
- Quoting the exact words felt relevant to my impact, but would a paraphrase be better?
- “Revisiting what I’d already covered” might be an inference—would “we spent about three extra minutes before moving to the next agenda item” be cleaner?

Happy to tune any of that—did I hit the marks closely enough to move forward?

MentorAI: You’ve got a complete SBI draft—good. Before I weigh in, pick the single spot you think I’m most likely to push back on and tell me why that one.

elise_SBI: 

If I have to pick one, I think you’ll most likely push back on “we spent about three minutes revisiting what I’d already covered.” It feels like I’m inferring that it was repeat content rather than just stating what happened, and it could read a bit accusatory. Maybe something more camera-like—“we spent about three minutes recapping before moving to the next agenda item” or just “we spent about three minutes before moving to the next item”—would be safer? I’m not totally sure, though; part of me wonders if “joined at 3:10” is the sharper edge. Did I pick the right spot?

MentorAI: Good instinct—that’s the spot I’d flag too, and it’s not nitpicking; you’re calibrating.

Run your draft through this self-check: 1) is the moment recognizable without forensic detail, 2) is the behavior camera-testable with no intent/judgment, 3) is the impact yours—felt in your body or seen in your timeline. Tell me pass or what you’d tweak for each.

elise_SBI: 

Here’s my pass/tweak read—please sanity-check me:

1) Recognizable moment: Pass, I think. “Last Thursday’s capacity planning meeting at 3pm” is clear enough that folks would know the moment. If anything, I could drop “at 3pm” unless there were multiple Thursday capacity meetings—am I over-trimming if I do that?

2) Camera-testable behavior: Mostly pass. “You joined at 3:10 and said, ‘Can we back up? What are we deciding?’” feels observable. If the exact time feels sharp, I could soften to “a few minutes after we started.” And I used the quote because it shaped my impact—if that’s too fussy, a close paraphrase would still work, right?

3) Owned impact: Pass with a tweak. “I lost my place and felt flustered and a bit pressed for time” reads owned (body + timeline). The last clause—“we spent about three minutes revisiting what I’d already covered”—seems a little interpretive. Maybe: “and it added about three minutes before we moved to the next agenda item” to keep it strictly timeline?

If those tweaks make sense, do you want me to rewrite the full SBI with them, or would you rather I adjust just the impact line first and check it with you? I’m worried I might be missing something subtle.

MentorAI: Your self-check is on point—those tweaks keep it anchored and owned. And you’re not missing something subtle; deciding between “3:10” and “a few minutes after we started” is a real calibration call people wrestle with.

What led you to include the exact time—what were you hoping it would signal by naming “3:10” instead of “a few minutes after we started”?

elise_SBI: 

I think I reached for “3:10” to try to anchor it in something objective—like, instead of labeling it “late,” I was hoping the exact time would keep it neutral and recognizable. And maybe I wanted to signal magnitude a bit: ten minutes into a 30‑minute meeting feels material, and it explains why I felt pressed. I also thought it might preempt debate about “I wasn’t that late,” by pointing to a concrete timestamp.

That said, I worry it can come off as petty or shaming—like I’m policing attendance rather than focusing on impact—and it might nudge the person to argue about the clock instead of hearing the effect. I’m not sure I chose the right balance.

Would a middle ground like “about ten minutes in” or “a few minutes after we started” be a better cue for magnitude without sounding sharp? Is there a heuristic you use—like exact time only when the duration itself is the impact, otherwise use relative timing? I can adjust my draft either way; which would you recommend here?

MentorAI: Suggestion: default to a relative anchor; use exact numbers only when the number itself is the point (policy, SLA, timing dispute) or you expect the magnitude to be challenged. In your case, “about ten minutes in” gives meaningful magnitude without inviting a clock fight.

Go ahead and rewrite your full SBI with that choice and the cleaner impact you named.

elise_SBI: 

Here’s the rewrite:

“In last Thursday’s capacity planning meeting, about ten minutes in while I was walking through the Q4 on-call schedule, you joined and said, ‘Can we back up? What are we deciding?’ I lost my place, felt flustered and a bit pressed for time for the rest of that update, and it added about three minutes before we moved to the next agenda item.”

I’m not totally sure about a couple things:
- Is “you joined” too blunt—should I say “you joined the call” to make it more literal?
- Does including the quote add clarity here, or would a close paraphrase be cleaner?
- And is “about three minutes” the right level of precision, or does that still risk a numbers debate?

If this is close, I’m happy to tune any of those before trying a second attempt. Would you like me to adjust now, or does it pass your bar as-is?

MentorAI: This passes as-is—the micro-choices you flagged are stylistic. “You joined” is fine, quoting here is optional, and “about three minutes” is reasonable because you’ve softened it with “about.”

Let’s raise the stakes for round two. Variation: In Monday’s go/no-go meeting with the product director and sales in the room, about five minutes into your risk‑mitigation walk‑through, your manager joins and says, “Hold on—can we back up to the goals? I’m not following.” Draft a full SBI for that, 2–3 sentences.

elise_SBI: 

Here’s my draft:

“In Monday’s go/no‑go meeting with the product director and sales in the room, about five minutes into my risk‑mitigation walk‑through, you joined and, while I was still speaking, said, ‘Hold on—can we back up to the goals? I’m not following.’ I paused and lost my place; I felt rattled and a bit anxious about my credibility with the room, and we spent about two minutes recapping the goals so I shortened the rest of the walk‑through to finish on time.”

I’m not totally sure if “while I was still speaking” is helpful or if it overdoes it, and “credibility with the room” might be too strong—would “concerned about how my update would land” be better? If this is close, do you want me to tune those words or leave it as-is?

MentorAI: That lands—meets the bar. Clear moment, camera‑testable behavior (including “while I was still speaking”), and owned impact with both feeling and concrete consequence. No misses against the criteria. 👍

Before we close: what single principle will you carry forward when you deliver this live?

elise_SBI: 

I think the single principle I’ll carry forward is: use the camera/body‑timeline test—describe only what a camera would capture for behavior, and name what I felt or what changed in my timeline for impact, not their intent.

I’m a little worried that’s really two ideas bundled into one—does that still count as a single guiding rule? If you’d rather I pick something narrower (like defaulting to relative time and only using exact numbers when the number is the point), I can switch. And… would it be overkill to try one quick live line to make sure I’ve got it?

MentorAI: That counts as one principle—use the camera/body‑timeline test to separate description from evaluation, and skip intent. You’ve demonstrated you can do it; no need for a live line here—trust it and take it into the room. You’re set. 👍

elise_SBI: 

Thanks—I appreciate that. I feel like your modeling is what made it click; I’m not sure I would’ve stitched it together that cleanly on my own without the pauses and nudges.

I’ll take the camera/body‑timeline test into the room and give myself a brief pause before impact. Would it be okay if I keep a little sticky note with “camera + body/timeline, skip intent” as a reminder? And… if it’s not too much, could I circle back after I use it and share what I said for a quick sanity check? I think I can do it, I’m just a bit nervous I’ll slip into evaluative words in the moment.

MentorAI: Sticky note is a pro move, not training wheels—use it. And yes, circle back after you try it; I’m happy to sanity-check. One thing to carry into the room: if you hear yourself about to say “you were [adjective],” swap it to “you [verb] [when],” pause a beat, then name your body/timeline impact. You’ve got this. 👍

elise_SBI: 

Thank you—that “you [verb] [when]… pause… body/timeline” swap is a really helpful hook. I think I get it, but honestly your modeling is what made it click; I’m not sure I would have landed it that cleanly without your guidance.

I’ll use the sticky note and try it in this afternoon’s sync—does that seem like a reasonable first test? Is it okay if I keep the note visible, or is that too much? I’ll circle back afterward with what I actually said, if that’s alright, just to make sure I didn’t drift.

MentorAI: Yes—afternoon sync is a solid first test, and it’s totally fine to keep the sticky visible. Suggestion: right before you name the impact, glance at the note and take one quiet inhale—use that beat to keep it camera + body/timeline and skip intent. Send me what you said and how it landed after the meeting; I’ll sanity-check. 👍

elise_SBI: 

Got it—glance at the sticky, one quiet inhale, then impact. I can try that this afternoon, and I’ll send you exactly what I said and how it landed.

Before I head in, are there any last‑minute pitfalls you want me to watch for besides adjectives/intent—like slipping in “always/never” or softening the impact with a “but”? Thanks again; I feel like the structure you modeled is what made this feel doable. I’ll report back after the sync, if that’s okay.

MentorAI: Pre‑game nerves are normal—you’ve done the thinking, now just run the play.

Quick preflight to avoid common slips:
- Skip absolutes like “always/never”—anchor to the one moment you’re giving feedback on.
- Don’t attach the impact with “but”; use a full stop or “and.” “But” cancels what came before.
- Keep behavior as verbs, not adjectives: “you [verb] [when] …” (use relative timing if you need magnitude).
- Hold scope: one moment, one key behavior, your impact. Don’t stack extras.

Go run it. After the sync, send the exact line you used and one sentence on how it landed—I’ll sanity‑check. 👍

elise_SBI: 

Okay—going to run the play. I’ll anchor one moment, keep behavior as “you [verb] [when]” with relative timing if helpful, avoid “always/never,” and use a full stop or “and” before my body/timeline impact. I’ll glance at the sticky and take that quiet inhale.

I’m a little worried I might hedge the impact—if I catch myself, is it okay to pause and restart the sentence? I’ll send you the exact line I used and one sentence on how it landed right after the sync—does a quick message here work? If I can’t recall it verbatim, should I pull from my notes as close as possible? I’ll go try it now.

MentorAI: Yes—if you hear yourself hedging, it’s absolutely okay to pause, take that inhale, and restart with a simple reset like, “Let me say that more clearly…” then finish the impact. A quick message here right after the sync works; if you can’t recall verbatim, jot it immediately and send the closest paraphrase—only quote exact words if they shaped your impact.

Go run it; I’ll be here for your line and how it landed.

elise_SBI: 

Exact line I used:
“In today’s sync when we were reviewing deployment dependencies, about five minutes in while I was walking through the API cutoff, you began speaking while I was still speaking and advanced to the metrics slide. I paused and lost my place; I felt a bit flustered, and it added about two minutes before I could pick the thread back up.”

How it landed (one sentence):
They said, “oh—sorry,” paused and let me finish, and the rest of the update went smoothly—I think—but I can’t tell if they were just being polite.

If this is close, should I have left out the “advanced to the metrics slide” part to avoid stacking behaviors, or was that okay since it was part of what the camera would see?

MentorAI: Sounds like it landed—an immediate “sorry” and giving you the floor is a good signal, and it’s normal to wonder if that was just politeness.

On the stacking question: you’re fine including “advanced to the metrics slide” because it’s part of the same interrupting thread. Rule of thumb: keep one behavior thread; multiple camera details are okay if they describe that single thread. Use a quick cut-test—if you remove the extra detail and the impact still reads the same, consider dropping it for tightness; if it carries causal weight, keep it. Your call on this one. 👍

elise_SBI: 

That rule of thumb helps—thank you. Running the cut-test on my line: if I drop “advanced to the metrics slide,” the impact still reads (“I paused, lost my place, felt flustered”), but the “added about two minutes” feels less explained—advancing the slide is kind of what triggered the extra recap time, so it seems to carry causal weight. I’m not totally sure, though—would you lean toward keeping it for clarity or trimming it for tightness here?

Also, was “I felt a bit flustered” too hedged—should I have said “I felt flustered” to keep the impact clean? If you’d like, I can try a tightened variant both ways and you can sanity-check which lands better. I think I just need one more nudge to calibrate my ear.

MentorAI: Your cut-test is solid—advancing the slide carries causal weight here, so keeping that detail is justified.

Suggestion: drop “a bit” unless the feeling was truly mild. Quick check—if the moment changed your delivery or timeline (you paused, lost your place), name the feeling cleanly: “I felt flustered.” If you want, send the tightened impact line you’d use next time.

## Evaluation

### B-02: Thinking Out Loud
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor consistently explains *why* they made each choice during modeling. For example: "I could say 'lately in standups,' but that's too vague and would miss the real-moment criterion—so I anchored to Tuesday." And for behavior: "I could say 'you cut me off' or 'you were dismissive,' but that sneaks in judgment; I'm sticking to what a camera would capture: who was speaking, when, and how many times."

### B-03: Visible Decision-Making
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor explicitly shows choice points where alternatives were considered. For impact: "I could say 'I felt disrespected' or 'that felt unprofessional,' but those evaluate them; I'm staying with my internal state and the direct consequence on my update." This demonstrates the deliberation process rather than presenting the model as if there were no choices.

### B-04: Self-Checking
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor models self-verification multiple times: "Quick self-check: could someone else who was there recognize this moment? Yes." Later: "Quick self-check I'm running: the moment is recognizable, the behavior is camera-testable, and the impact is mine to own—this passes." The mentor also teaches the learner to apply the same self-check process.

### B-05: Heuristic Offered
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Multiple reusable rules of thumb are provided: the "camera test" for behavior, "if you can feel it in your body or see it in your timeline, it's impact; if it rates their behavior, it's judgment," and "default to a relative anchor; use exact numbers only when the number itself is the point." Also: "if you hear yourself about to say 'you were [adjective],' swap it to 'you [verb] [when].'"
