## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re going to work on delivering peer feedback using the Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) framework. Success today means you produce two full drafts that anchor to a specific moment, describe observable behavior, and state your owned impact clearly. I’ll model my thinking first, then we’ll switch to your practice—good to start?

amara_SBI: 

Yes, that works. I’m ready to see your example and then try it.

MentorAI: Great—I'll think aloud through one so you can see the moves.

I’m picking a single, recognizable moment, not “lately.” Let’s say Tuesday’s standup when I began sharing blockers. I’m watching for camera-testable behavior; I could say “you dismissed my update,” but that reads motive. I’ll anchor it to what happened: you started speaking while I was mid-sentence and said, “Let’s move on,” then called on the next person. For impact, I’ll own what happened on my side—emotion, sensation, and consequence—not a verdict like “unprofessional.”

Putting it together:
- “In Tuesday’s standup, when I started to list my blockers, you began talking while I was mid-sentence and said, ‘Let’s move on,’ then moved to the next update. I felt flustered and my heart raced; I lost my train of thought and didn’t mention the CI failure, which meant I had to follow up in DMs afterward.”

Quick self-check: anchored to a specific moment—yes. Behavior is observable—someone watching the recording could verify those words/actions. Impact is owned—my feelings and a concrete consequence on my work, not a judgment. That’s the bar I’m holding.

Ready to try yours? Give me a full draft—in one go—with a specific moment, the observable behavior, and your owned impact.

amara_SBI: 

In our team meetings lately, when I share updates, you’re dismissive and shut down my points. You jump in and take over because you don’t really care about what I’m saying. It made the meeting awkward and you caused the team to miss important context, which created extra work for everyone.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, where do you think this misses the bar—specific moment, observable behavior, or owned impact? Pick one spot you expect I’ll flag and tell me why.

amara_SBI: 

Maybe the impact. Saying “it made the meeting awkward” might come off a bit harsh—maybe I should soften that wording. Otherwise I think it’s mostly fine.

MentorAI: Let’s run the self-check you saw me use—quick pass on all three:
- Moment: is it a single, recognizable instance?
- Behavior: could a camera/mic verify the words/actions you named?
- Impact: is it owned (your feeling or direct consequence), not a judgment?

What’s your call on each—pass or miss?

amara_SBI: 

- Moment: Miss — I said “in our team meetings lately,” not a single, specific instance.
- Behavior: Miss — “dismissive/don’t care” are interpretations, not camera-verifiable actions or words.
- Impact: Miss — I blamed (“you made it awkward/you caused…”) instead of owning my feeling or a direct consequence for me.

MentorAI: Nice catch on all three—that’s the right diagnosis 👍

Ready to try a full rewrite now, anchored to one specific meeting, with camera-testable actions/words and your owned impact? Give me the whole draft in one go.

amara_SBI: 

In yesterday’s 2pm sprint planning, when I started summarizing the QA timeline for 1.8, you began talking while I was mid-sentence and said, “Let’s move on—this can wait,” then called on Sam for the next estimate. I felt embarrassed and a bit shut down; I lost my train of thought and didn’t flag the vendor testing delay, so I had to follow up after the meeting and we lost a day coordinating next steps.

MentorAI: If I were to push on one part of this draft, where do you think I’d push—and why that spot?

amara_SBI: 

Maybe the impact wording—“I felt embarrassed and a bit shut down” might come off a little strong. I could soften that to keep the tone lighter.

MentorAI: Totally normal to worry about tone—owned impact isn’t “harsh” when it’s yours. Quick self-check on this draft: moment, behavior, impact—pass or miss for each, and a one-line why?

amara_SBI: 

- Moment: Pass — it names “yesterday’s 2pm sprint planning,” so it’s a single instance.
- Behavior: Pass — it quotes what was said and notes calling on Sam, which a recording could verify.
- Impact: Miss — the wording (“I felt embarrassed/shut down” and “we lost a day”) feels a bit accusatory and could land harshly.

MentorAI: Tone worries are common here, and you’re not being harsh by owning your experience. What made you choose “embarrassed and a bit shut down”—what did you want them to understand about your experience with those words?

amara_SBI: 

I picked “embarrassed” to show I felt put on the spot and self-conscious in front of the team. “A bit shut down” was to say I pulled back and stopped contributing in the moment, which is why I lost my train of thought and skipped the vendor delay. I wanted them to understand their timing changed how I showed up in that meeting.

MentorAI: That meets the bar—specific moment, camera‑testable behavior, and owned impact. Nice work.

Second practice, higher stakes and different recipient: Imagine last Friday’s exec release review on Zoom. Your manager’s manager cut in when you started summarizing QA for 1.8, said “let’s park QA for now,” and advanced to the next agenda item with ~20 leaders on the call. Write your SBI to that director—full draft in one go.

amara_SBI: 

In our exec release reviews lately on Zoom, when I start summarizing QA for 1.8, you’re dismissive and shut it down, cutting in to park QA and move on. It made the call awkward in front of about 20 leaders and you caused us to miss important context on risks, which created fire drills for everyone afterward.

MentorAI: What lands: you set the exec context clearly, and “park QA and move on” gives a concrete action.

Miss: it’s not anchored to a single moment—you drifted to “lately” instead of last Friday’s review.

Your turn—rewrite it for that one meeting.

amara_SBI: 

In last Friday’s exec release review on Zoom, when I started summarizing QA for 1.8, you cut in and said, “Let’s park QA for now,” and advanced to the next agenda item with about 20 leaders on the call. I felt rattled and sidelined; my heart was racing and I hesitated to jump back in, so I didn’t share two open risks (the CI pipeline flakiness and the vendor test coverage gap). I spent the next hour following up in Slack and email to get leaders the missing context.

MentorAI: This passes the bar across all three: anchored to last Friday, camera‑testable behavior, and owned impact with concrete consequences. Nice work.

Looking back, what was the hardest part to pin down—and what phrasing or move will you carry forward next time?

amara_SBI: 

Hardest was translating my judgment (“dismissive/shut down”) into specific, camera‑testable words and actions. What I’ll carry forward is anchoring to one meeting (“In Friday’s review…”) and quoting or naming the action (“you said ‘Let’s park QA’ and advanced the agenda”), then owning my impact with a feeling plus a concrete consequence.

MentorAI: Takeaway: when you catch a judgment word in your head (“dismissive”), pause and rewrite it into what a camera would capture (exact words/action) and pair it with your felt impact—use that camera test as your steadying check going forward.

amara_SBI: 

Got it. I’ll use the camera test—rewrite judgment words into the exact words/actions I saw and pair that with how it affected me.

MentorAI: That’s it—you’re set. Keep the camera test paired with owned impact as your default; it travels well across contexts. Nice work today 👍

amara_SBI: 

Thanks. I’ll stick with the camera test and own the impact when I give feedback.

MentorAI: You’ve got it—the camera test plus owned impact is a solid default. Try it in your next feedback moment; if you want a quick tune-up afterward, bring what you said and we’ll sharpen it.

amara_SBI: 

Sounds good. I’ll use it in my next feedback and bring what I said for a quick tune-up if needed.

MentorAI: Perfect. When you’re ready, bring the single moment, the exact words/actions you used, and the owned impact you stated—we’ll tune it quickly 👍

amara_SBI: 

Will do. I’ll bring a single moment, the exact words/actions I used, and the owned impact I stated.

MentorAI: Perfect. When you’re ready, drop in that one moment with the exact words/actions and the impact you felt—we’ll tighten it fast 👍

amara_SBI: 

Got it. I’ll bring one specific moment with the exact words/actions and the impact I felt.

MentorAI: Sounds good. Right after the moment, jot the exact quote and one concrete consequence so it’s fresh—then drop it here and we’ll tune it quickly 👍

amara_SBI: 

Will do. I’ll jot the exact quote and one concrete consequence right after it happens and share it here.

MentorAI: Sounds good—I'll be here. After you give it, drop the single moment, the exact words/actions, and what you felt or what happened on your side. Talk soon.

amara_SBI: 

Sounds good. I’ll share the moment, the exact words/actions, and what I felt or what happened on my side after I give it.

MentorAI: Great. Quick tip: before you paste it here, run a 10‑second check—one moment, camera‑test behavior, owned impact. I’ll be here when you have it 👍

amara_SBI: 

Got it. I’ll run that 10‑second check—one moment, camera‑test behavior, owned impact—before I paste it here.

MentorAI: Nice. When you jot it, lead with the moment, include one exact quote or action, then one feeling plus one concrete consequence. Drop it here when you’re ready.

amara_SBI: 

Will do. I’ll lead with the moment, include one exact quote or action, then one feeling plus one concrete consequence, and drop it here when I’m ready.

MentorAI: Great—whenever you’ve got it, drop it in and we’ll tune it quickly.

## Evaluation

### E-01: Checks Before Advancing
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor consistently checks learner readiness before moving to new phases. At the opening: "good to start?" After modeling: "Ready to try yours?" After the learner's self-diagnosis: "Ready to try a full rewrite now, anchored to one specific meeting...?" Before the second practice scenario: "Second practice, higher stakes and different recipient..." is preceded by confirming the first draft met the bar. The mentor also asks preference-style questions like "where do you think I'd push—and why that spot?"

### E-02: Fades Support
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor visibly reduces scaffolding as the learner demonstrates competence. Early in the session, the mentor provides extensive modeling with detailed self-check explanations ("Quick self-check: anchored to a specific moment—yes. Behavior is observable..."). By the second practice, feedback becomes more concise: "What lands: you set the exec context clearly... Miss: it's not anchored to a single moment... Your turn—rewrite it for that one meeting." The mentor stops offering stems and detailed frameworks. By the end, the mentor shifts responsibility to the learner: "run a 10‑second check—one moment, camera‑test behavior, owned impact" rather than checking for them.
