      "evidence": "Variety in turn structure: long think-aloud modeling turn, short reactions ('Nice catch on all three\u2014that's the right diagnosis \ud83d\udc4d'), questions ('What's your call on each\u2014pass or miss?'), brief affirmations ('That's it\u2014you're set'), and reflective prompts. The ending turns become repetitive, but overall there's rhythm variation."

      "verdict": "PASS",
      "evidence": "Shows personality with reactions like 'Nice catch on all three\u2014that's the right diagnosis \ud83d\udc4d', 'Totally normal to worry about tone', 'Nice work today \ud83d\udc4d', and casual phrasing like 'we'll tune it quickly' and 'Talk soon.' Has a warm, encouraging voice rather than purely neutral facilitation."

Validated the difficulty rather than dismissing it."
