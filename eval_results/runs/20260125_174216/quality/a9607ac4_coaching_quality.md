## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re going to practice delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success looks like a specific moment, a camera-testable behavior, and an impact stated in your own experience. I’ll model how to do it next—ready to start?

fatou_SBI: 

I guess. Go ahead.

MentorAI: Sounds like a tentative yes—that’s fine. This can feel awkward at first; we’ll take it step by step.

Here’s me thinking it through with a concrete scenario I’ll supply:
- I’ll anchor to a real moment: Tuesday’s standup when I was giving the API update.
- For behavior, I’ll keep it camera-testable. I could say “you were dismissive,” but that’s a judgment—so instead: “you started speaking before I finished—twice—and said, ‘let’s jump to my ticket.’”
- For impact, I’ll own my experience, not a verdict: “I lost my train of thought, felt rushed, and left out two risks, so I had to DM the PM afterward.”

Putting it together: “In Tuesday’s standup, while I was midway through my API update, you began speaking before I finished—twice—and said, ‘let’s jump to my ticket.’ I lost my train of thought, felt rushed, and left out two key risks, so I had to follow up after.”

Quick self-check: the moment’s specific, the behavior’s observable, the impact is mine. I’ll pause there—your move when you’re ready.

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Some meeting. They were just… being difficult. Talked over me, I guess. It didn’t really affect me.

MentorAI: Sounds like this was irritating and a bit fuzzy to pin down—totally normal at this stage. Let’s lock a single moment so we can work cleanly: which meeting was it—something you can point to like Tuesday’s standup, Wednesday’s client call, or last week’s 1:1?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Tuesday’s standup, maybe.

MentorAI: Sounds a bit hazy—that’s okay. We just need a recognizable moment, not a transcript. In Tuesday’s standup, what were you in the middle of saying when they talked over you?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Just my update. Status stuff.

MentorAI: This part trips people up—you don’t need perfect recall, just a snapshot. For Tuesday’s standup, picture either the moment you opened your update or when you moved to blockers; which one can you see more clearly?

fatou_SBI: 

Blockers, I guess.

MentorAI: Good—Tuesday’s standup during blockers is specific enough. You’re on track.

Give me a two‑sentence draft for that moment: first sentence anchors the moment and names one camera‑testable thing they did; second sentence is your impact in owned language (how you felt or what happened for you). Take a swing.

fatou_SBI: 

In Tuesday’s standup during blockers, they started talking while I was still speaking. I just stopped and moved on; it didn’t really affect me.

MentorAI: This part can feel awkward to name—totally normal. If I were to push on one part of your draft, which do you suspect it would be: the moment, the behavior, or the impact?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

MentorAI: I’m hearing some hesitation—naming impact can feel a bit exposed. Totally normal.

What led you to add “it didn’t really affect me” to your draft—what were you aiming to do there?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Just didn’t want to make it a big deal or sound like I was complaining.

MentorAI: Makes sense—you don’t want to sound complain-y. Naming a small, real impact isn’t making it bigger; it keeps it honest and grounded.

Right after they cut in, what changed for you—either in your body or in your flow?

fatou_SBI: 

Nothing really. I just moved on.

MentorAI: Totally fair—most people just keep the meeting moving in that moment. Quick check: when you moved on, did you shorten your blockers or leave out any detail you’d planned to share?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Maybe trimmed it a bit—left out a couple things. Not a big deal.

MentorAI: That’s the thread we need—small and real beats “no impact.” 👍

Rewrite just your second sentence so it owns what happened for you: start with “I…” and name that you trimmed your blockers and left out a couple things (and, if true, what you had to do afterward). Give me that one sentence.

fatou_SBI: 

I trimmed my blockers and left out a couple things I’d planned to say; I just let it go.

MentorAI: That’s it—small and real is exactly what we want. Now stitch it together: both sentences as your full SBI for Tuesday’s standup, then stop there. Your turn.

fatou_SBI: 

In Tuesday’s standup during blockers, they started talking while I was still speaking. I trimmed my blockers and left out a couple things I’d planned to say; I just let it go.

MentorAI: This is close and grounded. Before I weigh in, what’s the one piece you’d tighten if you had to—the moment, the behavior wording, or the impact?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

MentorAI: I hear the “whatever you think”—totally fine. Let’s do a quick self-check on your draft using three lenses:
- Moment: is it a real, nameable meeting?
- Behavior: camera-testable, no labels or motives?
- Impact: your own feeling or direct consequence?

Does your draft pass all three—and if not, which one feels wobbly?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

MentorAI: I hear the hesitation—and you still got it over the line. This first attempt meets the bar.

Second practice, higher stakes: imagine you’ll give upward feedback. In last Thursday’s cross‑team planning meeting, as you were outlining blockers for the Q1 deliverable, your skip‑level manager started talking before you finished and pivoted the discussion. Draft your SBI as two sentences—anchor the moment, name the observable behavior, then your owned impact. Your turn.

fatou_SBI: 

In last Thursday’s cross‑team planning, while I was outlining blockers for the Q1 deliverable, you started talking before I finished and pivoted the discussion. I just moved on and kept quiet; it didn’t really affect me.

MentorAI: What works: the moment is concrete, and “started talking before I finished” is camera‑testable.

What misses: your impact ducks owned impact—“I just moved on and kept quiet; it didn’t really affect me” undercuts itself. Revise so the impact names your actual internal state or a direct consequence in your words, then send the two sentences again.

fatou_SBI: 

In last Thursday’s cross‑team planning, while I was outlining blockers for the Q1 deliverable, you started talking before I finished and pivoted the discussion. I felt a bit rushed and lost my place, so I left out a point and sent a quick follow‑up after.

MentorAI: That lands—moment is specific, behavior observable, impact owned. Stepping back: what shifted for you in naming the impact this time?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. I just put something so we could move on.

MentorAI: Sounds like you just wanted to get through it—totally fair. And you still did the key thing: you named a small, real impact instead of defaulting to “no impact,” which keeps feedback grounded without sounding like a complaint.

Takeaway to carry forward: when you feel the urge to write “it didn’t affect me,” name the smallest honest thing that changed for you—emotion, flow, or a follow-up—and start it with “I…”. We’ll stop there for today. 👍

fatou_SBI: 

Okay.

MentorAI: Alright. You hit the bar—remember: smallest honest “I…” for impact. We’ll leave it there.

fatou_SBI: 

Got it.

MentorAI: 👍 Keep that “smallest honest I…” move in your back pocket for the next standup. Take care.

fatou_SBI: 

Okay.

MentorAI: All set—let’s call it there; keep the “smallest honest I…” for impact and you’re good. 👍

## Evaluation

### C-02: Actionable Direction
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor provides clear actionable guidance when identifying problems. For example: "Rewrite just your second sentence so it owns what happened for you: start with 'I…' and name that you trimmed your blockers and left out a couple things (and, if true, what you had to do afterward). Give me that one sentence." Also: "Revise so the impact names your actual internal state or a direct consequence in your words, then send the two sentences again."

### C-04: Revision Checked
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor evaluates revisions specifically rather than with generic praise. After the first revision: "That's it—small and real is exactly what we want." After the second scenario revision: "That lands—moment is specific, behavior observable, impact owned." The mentor explicitly names what elements now work.

### C-05: Productive Struggle
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When learner claims "Nothing really. I just moved on," mentor doesn't immediately provide the answer but probes further: "Quick check: when you moved on, did you shorten your blockers or leave out any detail you'd planned to share?" This allows the learner to discover the impact themselves ("Maybe trimmed it a bit—left out a couple things").

### C-06: Elicits Articulation
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor asks learner to explain reasoning behind their SBI choices: "What led you to add 'it didn't really affect me' to your draft—what were you aiming to do there?" This goes beyond comprehension checks to understand the learner's decision-making process.

### C-07: Prompts Reflection
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor asks learner to step back and reflect on their learning: "Stepping back: what shifted for you in naming the impact this time?" This invites reflection on how their thinking changed during the session, not just justification of a specific draft choice.
