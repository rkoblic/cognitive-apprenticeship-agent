These questions test whether the learner can distinguish between what they saw ('started talking while I was mid-sentence') versus what they concluded ('rude,' 'dismissive')."

Also offers sentence stem: 'start with \"In Wednesday's standup when I started the sprint update\u2026,\" add those two behaviors in neutral wording, and finish with your owned impact.'"
