After learner demonstrates competence with the Priya draft, mentor shifts to brief confirmations ('That passes'), asks for self-generated principles ('What's the single principle you'll carry forward'), and ends with micro-tips rather than structured guidance. Final exchanges are brief affirmations without scaffolding."
