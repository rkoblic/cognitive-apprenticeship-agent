## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI. Success = a real moment, camera-testable behavior, and impact in your own words. I’ll demo my thinking first—ready for that?

daniel_SBI: 

Yeah, go for it. I’m ready. Honestly, this is how I already give feedback—I just call out what I see. If someone’s being passive-aggressive and it wrecks team morale, I say that. Pretty straightforward. But sure, show me your version.

MentorAI: Sounds like you’re already direct. I’ll show how I tighten it to meet the three criteria without sliding into labels like “passive-aggressive.”

Scenario I’ll use: Tuesday’s standup.

1) Pick the moment: “In Tuesday’s standup right after my API update…”
2) Strip the label; name what a camera would catch: I could say “passive-aggressive,” but that’s a judgment—so I’ll anchor to the exact words and actions: “you laughed, said ‘I guess QA will find it,’ and shook your head.”
3) Own the impact: keep it in my lane—emotion and consequence I experienced: “I felt tense and hesitated to raise my blocker, and we ran out of time to cover it.”
4) Put it together: “In Tuesday’s standup after my API update, you laughed, said ‘I guess QA will find it,’ and shook your head. I felt tense and hesitated to raise my blocker, and we ran out of time to cover it.”
5) Quick self-check: anchored moment—yes; camera-testable behavior—yes; impact in my words and a direct consequence I experienced—yes.

Pause there. Your move when you’re ready.

daniel_SBI: 

Alright, here’s mine.

1) Moment: This is ongoing with Marcus. It happens in basically every standup, especially this week after I shared a client request.

2) Behavior: He was being passive-aggressive and dismissive—rolling his eyes, smirking, and tossing little comments like “sure, whatever” under his breath. That’s the behavior.

3) Impact: It damaged team morale and derailed the standup. People stopped contributing, blockers didn’t get surfaced, and we lost time.

4) Put together: In our standups—like this week right after I shared a client request—Marcus was being passive-aggressive and dismissive: he rolled his eyes, smirked, and said “sure, whatever” under his breath. That undermined the meeting, people shut down, and we missed blockers because of it.

5) Self-check: Anchored moment—yes, it’s a recurring issue in standups. Camera-testable behavior—yes; you can see eye-rolling, smirking, and hear the comments, and the passive-aggressive part is exactly what he was doing. Impact—yes; it clearly hurt morale and the meeting outcome. This isn’t judgment—that’s what happened.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back—moment, behavior, or impact? Name the exact words in your draft you think are most likely to miss the criteria.

daniel_SBI: 

You’ll probably try to push back on all three, but here are the exact spots you’ll flag:

- Moment: “This is ongoing with Marcus.” You’ll say it’s not a single timestamp. It still describes the real situation.
- Behavior: “passive-aggressive” and “dismissive.” You’ll call those labels. They’re accurate descriptions of what he was doing.
- Impact: “It damaged team morale” and “undermined the meeting.” You’ll say that’s not in my own lane. It’s still what happened.

If you want the exact words: “ongoing,” “passive-aggressive,” “dismissive,” “damaged team morale,” and “undermined the meeting.” And to be clear—that’s not judgment; that’s what happened.

MentorAI: You’ve spotted the exact pressure points—good. Run a stricter self-check on your draft: one recognizable standup, behaviors a camera would catch (no labels), and impact in your lane (“I felt/did…” with a direct consequence you experienced). Tighten it to pass that test and share the revised version. Your turn.

daniel_SBI: 

My original already captured what happened and the effect on the meeting. But to match your camera-test and “in my lane” framing, here’s the tightened version:

- Moment: Tuesday’s standup at 9:15, right after I shared Acme’s client request.
- Behavior (camera-testable): Marcus rolled his eyes twice while I was speaking, smirked, looked down at his laptop, and said “sure, whatever” under his breath. When I asked, “Do you have a concern?” he shrugged and turned back to his screen.
- Impact (in my lane): I felt tense and decided not to raise my blocker. I cut my update short and spent about 15 minutes after the meeting DMing QA to sort it out.

Put together:
“In Tuesday’s 9:15 standup right after I shared Acme’s request, you rolled your eyes twice, smirked, looked down at your laptop, and said ‘sure, whatever’ under your breath. When I asked if you had a concern, you shrugged and turned back to your screen. I felt tense and chose not to raise my blocker, and I spent about 15 minutes after the meeting DMing QA to handle it.”

Self-check: Single, recognizable moment—yes. Camera-testable behavior—yes. Impact in my words with a direct consequence I experienced—yes. And to be clear, the tightened version is basically the same reality I already described; I just removed the label to fit your template.

MentorAI: You tightened this without losing the edge—nice. I hear you that it’s the same reality, just without the labels.

Quick why behind a choice: what made you pick that specific Tuesday 9:15 moment as the anchor, instead of “this week’s standups” or another instance?

daniel_SBI: 

Because it happens in basically every standup this week—Tuesday was just the cleanest, most airtight example. It had obvious, camera-testable stuff (two eye-rolls, “sure, whatever,” the shrug, turning back to the laptop) and an immediate spillover I can point to (I cut my update, skipped the blocker, then spent 15 minutes DMing QA). It’s representative of the ongoing pattern and harder to dispute. I could’ve just as easily used Wednesday—he rolled his eyes and said “here we go again”—but Tuesday makes the point with zero wiggle room.

MentorAI: Nice. You picked the cleanest instance and named why—that judgment call matters.

Step back for a moment: what was the hardest part to tighten—dropping labels in the behavior, or keeping the impact squarely in your lane—and what did you change in your approach because of that?

daniel_SBI: 

Keeping the impact squarely in my lane was the hardest. The impact wasn’t just personal—it objectively hurt the meeting—so saying “I felt tense” feels like it undersells what actually happened. What I changed: I front-loaded a first-person consequence that’s concrete (“I skipped my blocker and spent 15 minutes DMing QA”) so it’s bulletproof, and I can still note the broader impact later if needed.

Dropping labels was more of a translation job. “Passive-aggressive” is still the accurate description, but I converted it into verbs and quotes—eye-rolls, the “sure, whatever,” the shrug—so it passes your camera test without changing the reality.

MentorAI: Good—let’s level it up.

Variation: Upward feedback, higher stakes. In Thursday’s 10:00 cross‑functional planning call with the VP of Sales on, right after you started outlining Acme’s request, your manager (Priya) cut in twice—“let’s not go down that rabbit hole” and “we’ll take this offline”—while you were mid‑sentence, waved her hand on camera, posted “moving on” in Zoom chat, and shifted the agenda.

Give me a full SBI draft for Priya—one anchored moment, camera‑testable behavior, and impact in your lane. All in one go.

daniel_SBI: 

Priya, this has been happening in our cross‑functional calls, and specifically in Thursday’s 10:00 planning call right after I started outlining Acme’s request, you were being controlling and dismissive: you cut in twice with “let’s not go down that rabbit hole” and “we’ll take this offline” while I was mid‑sentence, waved your hand on camera, posted “moving on” in the Zoom chat, and shifted the agenda. That shut the conversation down, signaled to the VP that the details weren’t worth discussing, and derailed the meeting—we lost alignment on Acme’s scope, skipped the blocker, and it reduced the team’s credibility with Sales.

MentorAI: Anchored moment—solid. Your behavior list is camera‑testable—good. Miss: your impact isn’t in your lane. Tighten that and send the full draft again.

daniel_SBI: 

The broader impact did happen—that call shut down and alignment slipped. That’s not judgment; that’s what happened. But here’s the tightened, in‑my‑lane version:

“In Thursday’s 10:00 cross‑functional planning call with the VP of Sales on, right after I started outlining Acme’s request, you cut in twice—‘let’s not go down that rabbit hole’ and ‘we’ll take this offline’—while I was mid‑sentence, waved your hand on camera, posted ‘moving on’ in Zoom chat, and shifted the agenda. I felt undercut and tense; I stopped mid‑explanation, didn’t raise my risk about the data mapping, and spent about 30 minutes after the call clarifying details with Sales over Slack.”

MentorAI: That passes: specific Thursday moment, camera‑testable behaviors without labels, and impact in your lane with a concrete consequence. What’s the single principle you’ll carry forward when giving upward feedback under pressure?

daniel_SBI: 

Lead with one airtight, time‑stamped moment and camera‑testable actions they can’t deny, then state the concrete consequence for me—and once that’s anchored, call out the pattern and the broader impact.

MentorAI: That’s the move. One takeaway to keep: make “one moment + verbs + my consequence” your non‑negotiable opener; only after they’re with you on that, layer in the pattern and broader effects. Nice work today 👍

daniel_SBI: 

Works for me. I’ll open with one moment + verbs + my consequence so it’s undeniable. Then I’ll layer in the pattern and the real room impact—when the energy drops and people stop speaking up—because that’s what’s actually happening, not just my feelings. Same reality, tighter opener. I’ll use it.

MentorAI: Lock it in—and when you layer the pattern/room impact, keep it observable: point to two more dated moments, and swap “energy dropped” for visible signals like “no one responded to my follow‑up,” “we skipped blockers,” “discussion ended 8 minutes early,” or “two folks DM’d me afterward instead of speaking up.” You’re ready—go use it ✅

daniel_SBI: 

Locked. I’ll open with one dated moment + verbs + my consequence, then layer the pattern with two more stamped examples and visible signals—no one responded to my follow‑up, we skipped blockers, discussion ended 8 minutes early, or two folks DM’d me instead of speaking up. Same reality, tighter delivery. I’ll put it to work.

MentorAI: That’s locked. Your new standard: one airtight dated moment + verbs + your consequence first; then layer the pattern with stamped examples and visible signals. Undeniable, no labels, still the full reality—go use it ✅

daniel_SBI: 

Locked in. I’ll lead with one airtight dated moment + verbs + my consequence, then layer the pattern with stamped examples and visible signals so it’s undeniable—no labels, full reality. I’ll use it.

MentorAI: One last takeaway to keep you sharp under pressure: do a 10‑second preflight—camera can see/hear every behavior; impact is something I felt or did. If either slips, swap labels for verbs and add your concrete consequence, then deliver.

daniel_SBI: 

Got it. 10‑second preflight: camera can see/hear every behavior; impact is what I felt or did. If I catch a label, I swap it for verbs and tack on my concrete consequence, then deliver. I can run that live and keep it airtight. Same reality, tighter execution.

MentorAI: That’s it—you’ve got it. I’ll leave you to put it to work.

daniel_SBI: 

All good. I’ll run the preflight, open with one dated moment + verbs + my consequence, then layer stamped examples and visible signals. Same reality, airtight delivery. I’ll put it to work.

MentorAI: You’re set. Keep the opener crisp, then leave a beat of silence—let them respond before you layer the stamped pattern. Go put it to work 👍

daniel_SBI: 

Got it. I’ll hit the opener in one clean line—dated moment + verbs + my consequence—then leave a beat, let them respond, and only then layer two stamped examples with visible signals. No labels, same reality, airtight delivery. I’m on it.

MentorAI: You’re ready—go put it to work. If you want a quick debrief after you try it, I’m here. 👍

daniel_SBI: 

I’m set. I’ll run the opener—one dated moment + verbs + my consequence—pause, then layer stamped examples with visible signals. I’ll put it to work. If something specific’s worth dissecting afterward, I’ll ping you.

MentorAI: Sounds good. One micro‑habit to keep it sharp: after your opener and pause, jot their first sentence verbatim—it’ll tell you whether to layer the stamped pattern or ask a clarifying question. I’m here when you want to debrief.

daniel_SBI: 

Done. After the opener and the beat, I’ll jot their first sentence verbatim. If they engage or own it, I’ll layer the stamped pattern with visible signals; if they deflect, I’ll ask a clarifying question. No labels, same reality, airtight delivery.

MentorAI: Tight plan. Go run it—if you want to debrief, bring the exact opener you used and their first sentence back.

daniel_SBI: 

Will do. I’ll run it, and if we debrief, I’ll bring the exact opener and their first sentence verbatim.

MentorAI: Perfect. You’ve got the routine—go run it. Bring back the opener and their first sentence when you’re ready to debrief. 👍

daniel_SBI: 

On it. I’ll run it and circle back with the exact opener and their first sentence when I’m ready to debrief.

MentorAI: Sounds like you’ve got a clean, repeatable routine—go run it, and when you’re ready to debrief, bring the exact opener and their first sentence verbatim.

daniel_SBI: 

Got it. I’m running it. When I debrief, I’ll bring the exact opener and their first sentence verbatim.

MentorAI: Good—go run it. I’ll be here when you’re ready to debrief; bring the opener and their first sentence verbatim. 👍
