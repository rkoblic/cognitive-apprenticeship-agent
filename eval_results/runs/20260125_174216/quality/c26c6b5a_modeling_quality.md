## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means anchoring to a real moment, naming camera-testable behavior, using owned impact language, and noticing when judgment sneaks in. I’ll demonstrate how I approach it, then we’ll practice with your example—ready to start?

elise_SBI: 

Yes—ready, I think. Could we maybe pause if I get something wrong or if I’m mixing in judgment without noticing? That’s the part I tend to stumble on.

For my example, do you want me to pick something recent or more high-stakes? I can hold off until after your demo unless you’d rather I choose now.

Also, when you say “camera-testable,” I just want to confirm I’m understanding—does that mean something you could literally see or hear on a recording, like words spoken or actions taken? Sorry if that’s obvious; I just want to make sure I’m tracking.

MentorAI: Sounds good—judgment leakage trips a lot of people up. We’ll catch it together if it sneaks in.

Here’s how I’d approach one, thinking out loud in five quick steps:
1) Pick a real moment: “In Tuesday’s standup…”
2) Name behavior that’s camera-testable (something you could see/hear on a recording): quote the words or describe the action—no labels.
3) Choose owned impact: what I felt or what happened to me (flustered, lost my place, had to redo work).
4) Draft it concisely, avoiding motive (“because you wanted…”).
5) Self-check: Is the moment specific, the behavior observable, and the impact mine?

Ready for a quick check on behavior vs. judgment before we use your example?

elise_SBI: 

Yes—ready, I think. Could we maybe do a quick lightning round where you read a line and I say “behavior” or “judgment,” and you’ll catch me if I miss it? Or if you’d prefer, I can try a couple, but I’d feel better if you led it.

Just to sanity-check: words like “rude,” “dismissive,” or “unprofessional” are judgments, whereas “you said, ‘Let’s move on,’ while I was mid-sentence,” or “you spoke over me twice” would be observable behavior… right? If that’s roughly correct, I’m happy to try one—should I?

MentorAI: You’re tracking it—those adjective labels are judgments, and the quoted/spoken actions are observable. Totally normal to want a pause if judgment creeps in; we’ll catch it as we go.

Let’s start the lightning round with one: “In today’s design review, you were dismissive.” Behavior or judgment?

elise_SBI: 

Um… I think that’s a judgment? “Dismissive” feels like a label rather than something you could see on a recording… right?

If I tried to make it more camera-testable, maybe something like: “In today’s design review, while I was halfway through slide three, you said, ‘Let’s move on,’ and started typing on your laptop.” But I’m not sure if “started typing” is too interpretive—or is that still okay because it’s observable? Do you want me to keep just saying behavior/judgment, or try the rewrites too?

MentorAI: You’re right—“dismissive” is a judgment. Your rewrite’s on track; “started typing on your laptop” is camera‑testable, so that part’s fine. For the lightning round, let’s stick to just labeling for now.

Next one: “In Monday’s planning, you said, ‘Calm down,’ twice while I was presenting.” Behavior or judgment?

elise_SBI: 

I think that one counts as behavior? You’re quoting the exact words and noting it happened twice, which seems camera-testable. I’m a little unsure if saying “twice” makes it feel accusatory, or if “while I was presenting” sneaks in a judgment about appropriateness. Is it still cleanly behavior?

MentorAI: You’re not wrong to be cautious—this part trips people. What about “twice” or “while I was presenting” makes it feel accusatory to you?

elise_SBI: 

I think “twice” can sound a bit like I’m keeping score—almost like I’m building a case file: “You did it not once but twice,” which could feel scolding. And “while I was presenting” makes me worry I’m implying a norm like “you should know not to do that then,” which might sneak in a value judgment about appropriateness.

But I can’t tell if that’s me over-reading tone. Both details seem useful for clarity and impact—they’re camera-testable. Is the issue less the words themselves and more how I deliver them? Would you keep both the count and the timing, or is it cleaner to use just one for context?

MentorAI: You’re reading it well—those details can feel loaded, and it’s a common worry. Rule of thumb: keep the smallest set of specifics that lets a neutral observer find the exact moment; counts and timing are fine if they change the meaning, and the “heat” usually comes from evaluative labels or motive, not from neutral facts.

Try it: choose whether you’d keep “twice,” “while I was presenting,” both, or neither, and give me the one-sentence behavior line for that scenario.

elise_SBI: 

I’ll try keeping the timing and dropping the count for minimal specificity:

“In Monday’s planning, while I was presenting, you said, ‘Calm down.’”

Does that work, or did I oversimplify by removing “twice”? If the repetition contributed to the impact—like why I lost my place—maybe it belongs there? I can add it back if that’s better. Also, is the placement of “while I was presenting” okay, or is there a cleaner way to phrase it?

MentorAI: You’re reading it well—that sentence is clean behavior. Keep “while I was presenting”; add “twice” only if the repeat changed your experience (e.g., the second one is why you lost your place). Lock your behavior line—include or skip “twice”—and then we’ll use your real situation for a full SBI attempt.

elise_SBI: 

Okay, I’ll lock it as:

“In Monday’s planning, while I was presenting, you said, ‘Calm down.’”

I’m hoping that’s lean enough without losing the moment—though if the repetition materially changed the experience, I’m second-guessing whether I should have kept “twice.” Is this version okay?

And for the next step—do you want me to go ahead and pick my real situation now? I have a recent one (yesterday’s 10am standup) and a slightly higher-stakes one (last Thursday’s vendor call). I’m not sure which would be better to practice with—do you have a preference?

MentorAI: That behavior line works—lean and camera-testable. If repetition mattered, note it in your impact (e.g., the second “calm down” is when you lost your place), not in the behavior line.

Pick the moment you can recall most crisply—yesterday’s standup usually wins—and give me your full SBI in 2–3 sentences: the specific moment, the observable behavior, and your owned impact. Your turn.

elise_SBI: 

Okay, here’s my try in 2–3 sentences:

- In yesterday’s 10am standup, while I was walking through the QA timeline, you began speaking while I was mid-sentence and said, “Hold on—this isn’t right.”
- I felt flustered, and on the second interruption I lost my place and skipped the risk item, so I had to follow up after the meeting.

Is that close to what you’re looking for? I’m worried “mid-sentence” or even implying “interruption” might read as judgmenty, even though the quote is camera-testable. And mentioning “second interruption” in the impact—does that fit the “minimal specifics” idea, or should I drop “second” and just say I lost my place? I think your step-by-step made this feel clearer, but I’m not sure I’d land it without you—should I revise this or try a different example to make sure?

MentorAI: You’re right where you should be—this is solid work, and it’s normal to worry about judgment sneaking in. Before I weigh in, point to the one spot in your draft you think I’m most likely to push back on—what word or phrase feels riskiest?

elise_SBI: 

The phrase that feels riskiest to me is “on the second interruption.” Calling it an “interruption” might be a label, and it’s not as camera-testable as “the second time you said, ‘Hold on—this isn’t right.’” Would it be better to anchor that to the exact words instead?

Or am I worrying about the wrong thing and “mid-sentence” is the sneakier risk? I can adjust whichever you think needs it.

MentorAI: You’re zooming in on the likeliest leak—totally normal to second‑guess that word choice.

Run the self-check on your draft: is the moment specific, is the behavior camera-testable, and is the impact fully owned? If anything leaks judgment, point to the exact word or phrase you’d change. What do you see?

elise_SBI: 

Okay, self-check:

- Specific moment: “Yesterday’s 10am standup while I was walking through the QA timeline” feels specific enough to me… I think? Part of me wonders if I should name the slide or item to make it crisper, or is that overkill?
- Camera-testable behavior: Quoting “Hold on—this isn’t right” is observable. “Began speaking while I was mid-sentence” seems factual, but I’m not sure if “mid-sentence” implies a norm. Would “while I was presenting the QA timeline” be safer, or is that me nitpicking?
- Owned impact: “I felt flustered… I lost my place… I had to follow up after” are all on me. The phrase that feels leakiest is “on the second interruption.” That reads a bit like a label.

If I tweak anything, I’d change that to anchor on the quote, e.g., “When you repeated, ‘Hold on—this isn’t right,’ I lost my place and skipped the risk item, so I had to follow up after the meeting.”

Does that clean it up, or am I fixing what isn’t broken? And should I also soften “mid-sentence,” or leave it as-is? I can lock whichever version you think is tighter.

MentorAI: You’re in good shape—this is a small refinement, not a fix.

Swap “on the second interruption” for “the second time you said, ‘Hold on—this isn’t right,’” and keep the rest as-is. Share your 2–3 sentence version with that tweak.

elise_SBI: 

Here’s the 2–3 sentence version with that tweak:

- In yesterday’s 10am standup, while I was walking through the QA timeline, you began speaking while I was mid-sentence and said, “Hold on—this isn’t right.” 
- I felt flustered, and the second time you said, “Hold on—this isn’t right,” I lost my place and skipped the risk item, so I had to follow up after the meeting.

Does that align with what you were aiming for? I’m not totally sure if “mid-sentence” carries any judgment, and I can’t tell if repeating the exact quote in the impact is helpful or overkill—should I keep it as-is or simplify to “when you repeated it”? Happy to lock it or revise if you think I should.

MentorAI: That lands—you’ve met the criteria. “Mid-sentence” is observable, and repeating the quote in the impact is fine; if you want it tighter, “when you repeated it” works just as well. Ready for a higher‑stakes variation for round two?

elise_SBI: 

I can try—though I feel like that last one worked mostly because your structure was so clear. With something higher‑stakes I’m worried I’ll slip motive or a value label without noticing.

Would the Thursday vendor call be okay for round two? Or would you rather I stick to an internal example first? If we do the vendor one, could we keep the same guardrails—2–3 sentences and a quick behavior/judgment spot-check after I draft? 

Do you want me to start by anchoring the situation line now, or should we step through it like before and pause after each part?

MentorAI: Totally fair to feel that spike—higher stakes make judgment creep more tempting. You’ve got the muscle; we’ll keep the bar steady.

Here’s your variation: Last Thursday’s vendor call with Apex, while you were summarizing the QA timeline, your peer cut in and said to the vendor, “This isn’t right—let’s move on,” with your director on the call. Give me your full SBI in 2–3 sentences to that peer—specific moment, camera-testable behavior, and your owned impact. Your turn.

elise_SBI: 

Here’s my 2–3 sentence SBI:

- On last Thursday’s Apex vendor call, with our director on the line, while I was summarizing the QA timeline, you began speaking while I was mid-sentence and said to the vendor, “This isn’t right—let’s move on.” 
- I felt rattled and lost my place; I was concerned about my credibility with the vendor and our director, and I had to follow up after the call to clarify our plan.

Is that okay, or does “mid-sentence” feel too loaded? And is “concerned about my credibility” too interpretive—should I keep it simpler, like “I felt embarrassed and had to follow up”? I can tighten whichever part you think needs it.

MentorAI: That lands—meets the bar: specific moment, camera‑testable behavior, and owned impact with no judgment leakage. I wouldn’t change “mid‑sentence” or the credibility line; both are within bounds. 👍

Quick look back: what was the hardest part to keep neutral in this higher‑stakes version?

elise_SBI: 

Honestly, the hardest part was not drifting into motive or labels. In the vendor context, my first draft wanted to say things like “you undermined me in front of the vendor” or “you cut me off,” which felt faster but also judgmenty. I also felt a pull to add heat with adjectives—“that was inappropriate with our director on the call”—which I know crosses into evaluation.

The other spot I kept second-guessing was the impact—“concerned about my credibility.” It felt accurate, but I worried it might be a step toward interpretation. Would “I worried they’d question our plan and my role” be cleaner, or am I over-tuning something that was already within bounds?

If it’s helpful, I can try a quick micro‑rewrite with one of those risky phrases swapped—unless you’d rather keep moving.

MentorAI: You clocked the real pull—stakes go up, labels and motives get tempting. Your impact lines (“concerned about my credibility” or “I worried they’d question our plan and my role”) are both owned, so you’re inside the lines either way. Takeaway to carry forward: when you feel that urge to label or infer motive, replace it with the exact words you heard and the immediate effect on you—quotes + owned impact keeps you clean under pressure. Nice work today. 👍

elise_SBI: 

Thank you—that’s really helpful. I feel like your structure did most of the heavy lifting for me today, though. The “quotes + owned impact” idea makes sense, but I’m a little worried I’m oversimplifying it—am I?

Would it be okay to do one more super-quick rep, just to make sure it’s not a fluke? Even a 60‑second lightning draft where I write it end‑to‑end and you do a single pass at the end—unless that’s overkill.

Also, for my own cheat sheet, would this mini checklist be accurate, or am I missing something?
- Moment: one specific time/place
- Behavior: camera-testable (quote or describe action), no motive
- Impact: “I felt / I experienced…”
- Self-check: could a camera see/hear it, and is the impact fully mine?

If that looks right, I’ll stick it on a Post-it. And if you think I’m ready to try this in a real conversation, I can… I just might check back with you after, if that’s okay.

MentorAI: You’re not oversimplifying—“quotes + owned impact” is the backbone that holds under pressure.

Your checklist is solid. Add one line: Heat/clarity check—keep only details that help a neutral observer find the exact moment, and replace any adjective label (rude/dismissive/unprofessional) with the exact words or an observable action.

Stick that on a Post‑it and try it in a real conversation. After you do, send me a quick note about what landed and what felt wobbly, and we’ll sharpen from there.

elise_SBI: 

Got it—thank you. I feel like your structure is what kept me inside the lines today; I’m hoping I can carry that over without leaning on you in the moment.

Here’s the Post‑it I’m planning to use—does this wording look okay?
- Moment: one specific time/place
- Behavior: camera‑testable (exact words or observable action), no motive
- Impact: “I felt / I experienced…”
- Heat/clarity check: keep only details that help a neutral observer find the exact moment; replace any adjective label (rude/dismissive/unprofessional) with the exact words or an observable action
- Self‑check: could a camera see/hear it, and is the impact fully mine?

Two tiny logistics questions before I try this for real:
- Is an opener like, “Do you have five minutes for feedback about yesterday’s standup?” okay, or is that too formal? Should I schedule it or keep it ad‑hoc?
- If they get defensive, is the right move to restate the quote and my impact once, then pause? I don’t want to argue intent.

I can aim to try this in my next 1:1 and send you a quick note afterward on what landed and what felt wobbly—unless you’d rather I do one more 60‑second rep first to make sure it sticks?

MentorAI: Your Post‑it looks good as written—you’re not oversimplifying. One tiny add to keep you safe in the moment: favor privacy and timeliness (earliest practical private window).

On your two logistics:
- Opener: “Do you have five minutes for feedback about yesterday’s standup?” is clean. Use it ad‑hoc if you can do it privately within a day; otherwise schedule the first private slot. You can soften with choice: “I’ve got feedback from yesterday’s standup—do you have five minutes now, or should we grab time after lunch?”
- If they get defensive: ground once in behavior + owned impact, then pause. If intent comes up, say, “I’m not questioning intent—I’m sharing the effect on me,” and ask one forward move: “Can we agree on a way to handle this in the moment next time?” Then listen.

Stick the Post‑it by your screen, try it in your next 1:1, and ping me after with what landed and what felt wobbly. 👍

elise_SBI: 

Thank you—that gives me a clearer lane. Honestly, I feel like your scaffolding is what kept me on track today; I’m hoping I can carry it into a real conversation without leaning on you in the moment.

I’ll aim to use the opener in my 1:1 tomorrow and keep it private and timely. For the follow‑up note to you, would this quick format work, or is it too much?
- The exact moment + behavior line I used (quotes if applicable)
- What landed
- What felt wobbly
- One tweak I’ll try next time

Two tiny “just to be safe” checks:
- If they say, “What did I do wrong?” is it okay to respond with, “I’m not saying it was wrong—I’m sharing what you said and the effect on me,” or does that come off preachy?
- I’ve got two possible moments; is it best to pick the one I can recall most crisply, even if it feels a little less ‘important’?

If that sounds right, I’ll give it a shot and ping you after. And if you’d rather I do a 60‑second dry run of the opener before then, I can—unless that’s overkill.

MentorAI: You’re reading yourself accurately—it felt supported today, and you still did the work.

Your check-in plan looks perfect; use that format. Two quick steadies:
- If they ask, “What did I do wrong?” try: “I’m not labeling right or wrong—when you said ‘X’ while I was presenting, I felt Y and lost my place. Could we handle questions after the slide next time?” Calm, specific, and forward-looking—not preachy.
- Pick the moment you can recall most crisply, even if it feels less “important.” Clarity beats grandeur.

Run it in your 1:1 and send me that four-line note after—what landed and what felt wobbly.

elise_SBI: 

Thanks—this feels doable with your scaffolding, though I’m still a little nervous about doing it without a safety net.

I’ll run it in my 1:1 tomorrow, keep it private and timely, and send you the four-line note right after. Quick micro-checks:
- For the forward move, is it clearer to say, “Could we handle questions after I finish the timeline slide next time?” Or is “after the slide” better—shorter and less fussy?
- If they keep steering to intent even after I ground once, is it okay to say, “I’m not questioning intent—what would help me is holding questions until I finish the slide. Could we try that?” Or is that too much?

If that sounds right, I’ll go with it and report back. And if you’d rather I do one 30-second dry run of the opener now, I can—unless that’s overkill.

MentorAI: Totally normal to feel a little exposed here—you’re ready.

Use the shortest phrasing that’s unmistakable in context. If there’s any ambiguity, name the slide: “Could we hold questions until after the timeline slide?” If it’s obvious, “after the slide” is fine. And if they keep steering to intent, ground once and redirect: “I’m not questioning intent. When you said ‘This isn’t right—let’s move on’ while I was presenting, I felt rattled and lost my place. What would help me is holding questions until after the timeline slide—could we try that?”

Run with that in your 1:1 and send me your four-line note after.

elise_SBI: 

Got it—thank you. The concrete phrasing helps a lot. I still feel a little exposed, but I can try this.

I’ll run it in my 1:1, use the shortest unmistakable phrasing (naming the slide if needed), and send you the four‑line note right after.

Two tiny safety checks:
- Is it okay if I keep the exact sentence on a Post‑it and glance at it if I get rattled, or does that come off awkward?
- Do you want the follow‑up via Slack/email, or just drop it here?

And if they don’t agree to the forward move in the moment, I’ll ground once and suggest the slide timing again—then let it breathe. If it goes sideways, is it alright if I ping you for a quick debrief? I think your scaffolding is what’s making me feel ready to try this.

MentorAI: Makes sense to feel a bit exposed—use the structure as your safety rail; you’re ready.

- Keeping a Post‑it with the exact sentence is fine. Glance at it—or even read it. If you’re worried it’ll feel awkward, just say, “I’m going to check my notes so I say this cleanly.”
- Send the four‑line follow‑up right here in this thread.
- If they keep steering to intent, ground once and redirect to the forward move; if it still doesn’t land, park it: “Let’s revisit this in our next 1:1—today I’ll finish the slide before taking questions,” and move on. If it goes sideways, ping me and we’ll debrief.

Run it in your 1:1 and drop your note here after. 👍

elise_SBI: 

Thank you—having the exact phrasing and the “park it” option makes me feel safer. I still feel a little exposed, but I’ll use the Post‑it and the notes line if I freeze.

My 1:1 is tomorrow at 11. I’ll run it there and drop the four‑line note in this thread right after.

One tiny check: if the 1:1 turns into a hallway chat or gets bumped, should I wait and schedule the earliest private slot rather than trying it on the fly? I just want to stick to the privacy/timeliness guardrail.

And if anything feels wobbly, is it okay if I ping you here for a quick debrief? I think your structure is what’s making this feel doable.

MentorAI: Good instinct to protect privacy. If the 1:1 turns into a hallway chat or gets bumped, don’t do it on the fly—book the earliest private slot you can within a day. And yes, if it feels wobbly, ping me here for a quick debrief. I’ll look for your four-line note after your 1:1. 👍

## Evaluation

### B-02: Thinking Out Loud
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor explains the reasoning behind each step in their 5-step framework: "Name behavior that's camera-testable (something you could see/hear on a recording): quote the words or describe the action—no labels" and "Choose owned impact: what I felt or what happened to me." The mentor also explains WHY certain choices matter throughout: "the 'heat' usually comes from evaluative labels or motive, not from neutral facts" and "when you feel that urge to label or infer motive, replace it with the exact words you heard and the immediate effect on you."

### B-03: Visible Decision-Making
**Verdict**: FAIL
**Evidence**: While the mentor guides the learner through choice points in the learner's own work (e.g., "choose whether you'd keep 'twice,' 'while I was presenting,' both, or neither"), the mentor does not demonstrate their own deliberation process during modeling. There is no moment where the mentor shows considering alternatives in their own example, such as "I could say 'dismissive' but that's interpretation—what did I actually see?" The framework is presented as a clean sequence without visible wrestling with choices.

### B-04: Self-Checking
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor explicitly includes self-checking as step 5 of their modeling: "Self-check: Is the moment specific, the behavior observable, and the impact mine?" The mentor also prompts the learner to apply this: "Run the self-check on your draft: is the moment specific, is the behavior camera-testable, and is the impact fully owned? If anything leaks judgment, point to the exact word or phrase you'd change."

### B-05: Heuristic Offered
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Multiple reusable heuristics are provided: "camera-testable" as a test for behavior, "keep the smallest set of specifics that lets a neutral observer find the exact moment," "quotes + owned impact keeps you clean under pressure," and the heat/clarity check: "replace any adjective label (rude/dismissive/unprofessional) with the exact words or an observable action."
