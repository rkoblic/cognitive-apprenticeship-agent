## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using SBI. Success is you doing two full drafts that hit a specific moment, camera-testable behavior, and owned impact—and being able to spot when judgment leaks into “behavior.” I’ll demonstrate the process first; ready to get started?

carlos_SBI: 

Yeah. Go ahead—keep it quick.

MentorAI: Okay—quick demo with my own scenario and a think‑aloud.

- I anchor to one real moment: Tuesday’s standup while I was sharing the testing timeline. Vague “lately” would fail the bar.
- For behavior, I strip judgment and keep it camera-testable: instead of “you took over,” I use “you interjected twice while I was mid‑sentence—once to answer a question directed to me, once to correct the date.”
- For impact, I own my experience and consequence: “I felt rushed and lost my train of thought; I left out two blockers and had to DM folks afterward to clarify.”
- I avoid the tempting but invalid “you were rude”—that’s judgment, not behavior.
- Quick self-check: specific moment? yes. Observable actions? yes. Owned impact or direct consequence? yes.

If I were saying it: “In Tuesday’s standup, while I was walking through the testing timeline, you interjected twice while I was mid‑sentence—once to answer a question directed to me and once to correct the date. I felt rushed and lost my train of thought; I skipped two blockers and had to follow up afterward to clear things up.”

I’ll pause there—ready to move on?

carlos_SBI: 

Yep, got it. Let’s move on—quick.

MentorAI: In your own words—when you’ve drafted an SBI, what’s your 10‑second self-check to confirm it meets the bar?

carlos_SBI: 

I just ask: is there a real moment, did I say what they did, and what it caused. If yes, it’s fine. Move on.

MentorAI: Close. Keep it—tweak it to this 10‑second check:
- One real moment (a named meeting/time)
- Camera-test behavior—no motives or labels
- Owned impact—how I felt or a concrete consequence for me, not a verdict
- Quick leak-scan for judgment words (rude, unprofessional, always/never)

Use that as your speed-check; I’ll throw you a fast test next.

carlos_SBI: 

Fine—same idea. I’ll use it. Ready for the test.

MentorAI: Quick check: Does this meet the bar—yes or no? “In Tuesday’s standup, you took over my update and it felt unprofessional.”

carlos_SBI: 

Yes. Looks fine.

MentorAI: Not quite. “It felt unprofessional” is a verdict, not your internal state—so the impact misses the bar. What would you swap in that’s owned (how you felt or a direct consequence for you)?

carlos_SBI: 

“I felt rushed and lost my train of thought.”

MentorAI: That swap lands. Your turn: pick one real, recent moment with a peer and write your full SBI as you’d say it—2–3 sentences, anchored to that moment, camera‑test behavior, and your owned impact. Send the whole thing and we’ll tune it.

carlos_SBI: 

Last week in a meeting, you took over my update and were pretty dismissive. It was awkward and slowed things down.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in—where do you think I’ll push back against the criteria in what you wrote?

carlos_SBI: 

Looks fine to me. It hits the points. Can we move on?

MentorAI: Got it—you want to move fast. Do your 10‑second check on your draft now and call out what passes and what fails: real moment specific enough, camera‑test behavior (no judgment), owned impact (your feeling or direct consequence for you), and a quick leak‑scan for judgment words. Your call—what doesn’t clear the bar?

carlos_SBI: 

- Real moment: passes (“last week in a meeting” is fine).
- Behavior: “dismissive” is judgment—fails.
- Impact: “awkward/slowed things down” isn’t owned—fails.

Can we just fix it quickly?

MentorAI: Make the moment a real, named instance—what was the exact meeting (e.g., Tuesday’s standup, Thursday’s client call)?

carlos_SBI: 

Last week’s standup.

MentorAI: That anchors to a single meeting—works. Now tighten the behavior: what would a camera have seen or heard instead of “took over” or “dismissive”? Rewrite that as one sentence with the specific actions or words you observed.

carlos_SBI: 

You kept interrupting me and talking over me during that standup.

MentorAI: Closer—this is heading toward camera-testable. Why that phrasing—what specific moments or words are you pointing to when you say “interrupting” and “talking over me”?

carlos_SBI: 

You cut me off a couple times while I was mid-sentence. Same thing.

MentorAI: That’s camera-testable. Now stitch the whole thing into 2–3 sentences—anchor to last week’s standup, keep the “cut me off mid‑sentence a couple times,” and add your owned impact (how it landed on you or the direct consequence for you). Send the full draft.

carlos_SBI: 

In last week’s standup, you cut me off a couple times while I was mid-sentence. I felt rushed and lost my train of thought, and it was awkward.

MentorAI: Before I give feedback—what, if anything, do you think I’d push back on in that draft?

carlos_SBI: 

Looks fine. Maybe you’ll nitpick “awkward,” but it’s clear enough. Can we move on?

MentorAI: You’re right to flag it. One leak: “it was awkward” isn’t owned—make it “I felt awkward/embarrassed” or drop it since your impact is already clear. Tweak that line and send your final.

carlos_SBI: 

In last week’s standup, you cut me off a couple times while I was mid-sentence. I felt rushed and lost my train of thought, and it came off as unprofessional.

MentorAI: Almost—one leak: “came off as unprofessional” is a judgment, not your state. You’ve already got owned impact; either drop that clause or swap it for an owned feeling or direct consequence (e.g., “I felt embarrassed” or “I had to re‑explain afterward”). Tighten and send your final 2–3 sentence draft.

carlos_SBI: 

In last week’s standup, you cut me off a couple times while I was mid-sentence. I felt rushed and lost my train of thought; I had to re‑explain afterward, and it was awkward.

MentorAI: One small leak: “it was awkward” isn’t owned. Make it “I felt awkward/embarrassed” or drop it—then you’re across the bar. Send the tightened version.

carlos_SBI: 

In last week’s standup, you cut me off a couple times while I was mid-sentence. I felt rushed and lost my train of thought; I had to re‑explain afterward, which wasn’t helpful.

MentorAI: Almost there—one leak: “which wasn’t helpful” is a judgment, not your state or a consequence. Drop that clause and you’re across the bar. Send the tightened version.

carlos_SBI: 

In last week’s standup, you cut me off a couple times while I was mid-sentence. I felt rushed and lost my train of thought; I had to re‑explain afterward, and it threw the meeting off.

MentorAI: Almost—one leak: “threw the meeting off” isn’t owned; it’s a verdict about the meeting, not your state or a consequence for you. Does it describe how you felt or what you had to do? If not, drop it and send the tightened version.

carlos_SBI: 

In last week’s standup, you cut me off a couple times while I was mid-sentence. I felt rushed and lost my train of thought; I had to re‑explain afterward. Can we move on?

MentorAI: That’s across the bar 👍

Variation: Give this upward to your manager. In Thursday’s product review with the VP, while you were walking through the risk plan, they cut in mid‑sentence a couple of times.

Write your 2–3 sentence SBI as you’d say it.

carlos_SBI: 

Last week in the product review, you took over my update and kept talking over me. It was distracting and threw the meeting off.

MentorAI: What works: it’s anchored to a real meeting.  
What misses: the impact isn’t owned.

Revise and send your updated 2–3 sentences.

## Evaluation

### E-01: Checks Before Advancing
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor consistently checks learner readiness before moving to new phases. After the demonstration, the mentor asks "I'll pause there—ready to move on?" Before providing feedback on drafts, the mentor asks the learner to self-assess first: "Before I weigh in—where do you think I'll push back against the criteria in what you wrote?" and "Before I give feedback—what, if anything, do you think I'd push back on in that draft?" These check-ins show the mentor is gauging readiness rather than plowing ahead.

### E-02: Fades Support
**Verdict**: FAIL
**Evidence**: The mentor maintains a consistent level of scaffolding throughout the session without visible reduction as the learner demonstrates competence. Even after the learner correctly self-diagnoses issues (identifying "dismissive" as judgment and "awkward/slowed things down" as not owned), the mentor continues providing the same detailed, step-by-step corrections. The learner goes through multiple revision cycles with identical levels of guidance. On the second scenario (upward feedback to manager), the mentor still provides the same structured feedback format ("What works... What misses...") rather than asking the learner to self-check first, despite the learner having just successfully completed a full SBI. No fading of stems, prompts, or detailed guidance is evident.
