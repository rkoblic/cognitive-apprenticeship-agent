      "verdict": "FAIL",
      "evidence": "The mentor is entirely procedural throughout. The only hint of personality is a single '\ud83d\udc4d' emoji. No humor, opinions, reactions like 'Oh, that's a good one,' or human touches. Could be any interchangeable tutor."

Mentor acknowledges once with 'Got it\u2014you want to move fast' but then continues with the same approach unchanged, pressing forward with more iterations rather than adjusting pace or validating the frustration."
