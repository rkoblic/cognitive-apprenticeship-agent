By the solo attempt, mentor gives minimal guidance ('tighten to own only your impact and drop the hedges\u2014give me a clean 2\u20133 sentence revision') and by the end simply confirms 'That lands\u2014meets the bar' without offering stems or detailed breakdowns. Final exchanges focus on practical application tips rather than SBI component instruction."
