## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’ll work on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a real moment, describe observable behavior, and state impact in your own experience; you’ll do two full attempts—first with support, then on your own. I’ll demonstrate the thinking process once before you try—ready to begin?

bailey_SBI: 

Yes—ready. It would help a lot to see your thinking process first.

Do you want me to pick a situation now, or wait until after your demo? I have a couple in mind, but I tend to get stuck on whether it’s specific enough—like “was it Tuesday or last week?”—so I might need help choosing. Is that okay?

Also, just to check: when you say impact “in my own experience,” is that basically using “I felt…” language? I think so, but I’m not 100% sure.

MentorAI: Totally okay to not remember the exact day—“a recognizable moment” is enough. And yes, impact is your own experience (emotion, body, or consequence), not a judgment dressed up as a feeling. Here’s my think‑aloud on one scenario so you can see the moves:

- 1) Anchor the moment: I’ll pick “in Tuesday’s standup” instead of “lately,” which is specific enough to recognize without timestamps.
- 2) Isolate observable behavior: I could say “you were dismissive,” but that’s a judgment. Camera-test version: “you jumped in while I was speaking—twice—before I finished my sentences.”
- 3) Own the impact: Use my experience, not verdicts. “I felt flustered and my heart sped up; I lost my train of thought and skipped mentioning the deployment risk.”
- 4) Put it together: “In Tuesday’s standup, you jumped in while I was speaking—twice—before I finished. I felt flustered, lost my train of thought, and ended up skipping the deployment risk.”
- 5) Quick self-check: Moment is real? Yes. Behavior observable? Yes. Impact owned (felt/lost/skipped)? Yes. Any leaked judgment? Don’t see any; “dismissive” stayed out.

Want a quick diagnostic check next, or do you feel ready to try your own first draft using this?

bailey_SBI: 

A quick diagnostic would help, please.

I’ve got a couple moments in mind and I’m not sure which is better: one is from this morning’s design review where Jordan started answering the question before I finished, and the other is last week’s sync where they came in late and we had to pause to catch them up. The first one feels closer to your example, but I’m nervous I’m reading too much into it. Which would be easier to work with?

Also, tiny wording worry: is “interrupted me” okay, or is that already a judgment-y term and I should say something like “started talking while I was still speaking”?

For impact, would “I felt flustered and kind of small” be okay, or is “small” too interpretive? And does “I skipped mentioning X risk” count as impact (since it changed what I did), or is that more of a consequence and I should stick to feelings? Sorry for all the nitpicking—I just want to make sure I’m aiming at the right level before I try a draft. Does that make sense?

MentorAI: Totally makes sense—you’re being precise, not nitpicky. This part trips a lot of people up, and you’re not missing something obvious.

Quick check: for each line below, say pass or fail against the SBI criteria and one‑sentence why.
- “In this morning’s design review…”
- “You interrupted me.”
- “You started talking while I was still speaking.”
- “I felt flustered and kind of small.”
- “I skipped mentioning the deployment risk.”

Then we’ll pick your moment and have you draft.

bailey_SBI: 

- “In this morning’s design review…” — Pass — It anchors to a recognizable moment (time/context) without judgment, I think.
- “You interrupted me.” — Fail — It feels a bit judgment-y and not very camera-test specific (and missing how many times).
- “You started talking while I was still speaking.” — Pass — That sounds observable and neutral.
- “I felt flustered and kind of small.” — Fail — “Small” feels interpretive/loaded, so it seems like judgment might be leaking in.
- “I skipped mentioning the deployment risk.” — Fail — This seems more like a consequence of the moment than a feeling in my experience, so I’m worried it doesn’t fit “impact.”

I might be over-cautious—did I mark too many as fails? If “interrupted me” and “skipped mentioning” actually pass, could you help me see why? Sorry if I’m overthinking.

MentorAI: You’re not overthinking—this is the right level of precision 👍

Quick read on your calls:
- “In this morning’s design review…” — Pass.
- “You interrupted me.” — Acceptable but weaker; it’s a label. The camera-test version (“you started talking while I was still speaking”) is stronger—add count if you have it.
- “You started talking while I was still speaking.” — Pass.
- “I felt flustered and kind of small.” — Pass. “Small” is owned; if you want to de-mistify it, swap to a clearer emotion (e.g., embarrassed) or a body cue (e.g., “my chest tightened”).
- “I skipped mentioning the deployment risk.” — Pass. Impact can be emotion, body, or immediate consequence to your actions; this fits.

For a first draft, the design review moment is easier—tight behavior, easy to camera-test.

Your turn: write a 2–3 sentence SBI message to Jordan about this morning’s design review—anchor the moment, describe the observable behavior (include “once/twice” if you can), and name your impact in your own experience.

bailey_SBI: 

In this morning’s design review—during the Q&A part, I think—you kind of started talking while I was still speaking, maybe twice, and it felt a bit dismissive. That made things feel a little off for me and I sort of lost my train of thought, so I didn’t really get into the deployment risk.

Is that too harsh? I’m not sure if “dismissive” is crossing the line into judgment—should I change that?

MentorAI: You’re reading the tone thoughtfully—that “is this too harsh?” check is exactly the right instinct, and lots of people worry about that at this stage.

Before I weigh in: aside from “dismissive,” what’s one other spot you think I might push on against the criteria or ask you to tighten?

bailey_SBI: 

I think you’d probably push on “made things feel a little off”—that sounds vague and not really owned. I could swap it for something clearer like “I felt flustered” (maybe add a body cue) and keep the concrete part about losing my train of thought and skipping the risk.

Does that seem like the right fix, or would you rather I tighten the “maybe twice/kind of” wording first? I’m not sure which matters more.

MentorAI: You’re right that “a little off” is vague. Run the quick check on your draft—real moment, camera‑test behavior, owned impact—and call out any judgment words you spot (e.g., “dismissive”); which piece needs the first fix?

bailey_SBI: 

Quick check on my draft:

- Real moment: “In this morning’s design review—during the Q&A part, I think…” — Mostly pass; it’s a real moment, but the “I think” makes it wobbly. I could drop that.
- Camera-test behavior: “you kind of started talking while I was still speaking, maybe twice” — Observable, but the “kind of/maybe” weaken it; I should tighten the count if I have it.
- Owned impact: Mixed — “felt a bit dismissive” reads like a judgment label, “made things feel a little off” is vague; “I lost my train of thought” and “I didn’t get into the deployment risk” are owned consequences.

Judgment words I spot: “dismissive” (and maybe the hedge-y “kind of” isn’t judgment but still not great).

Which piece to fix first: the impact—remove “dismissive” and replace the vague bit with owned experience (e.g., “I felt flustered; my heart sped up; I lost my train of thought and skipped the deployment risk”). Then second, tighten the behavior (drop “kind of/maybe,” add the count).

Does that prioritization make sense, or would you rather I firm up the behavior line first?

MentorAI: Your prioritization makes sense—fix the impact first, then tighten the hedge words on the behavior 👍 Go ahead and rewrite your 2–3 sentence message now with owned impact and a firmer behavior line. Your turn.

bailey_SBI: 

In this morning’s design review, you started talking while I was still speaking—twice—before I finished. I felt flustered; my heart sped up, and I lost my train of thought and skipped mentioning the deployment risk.

Is that too much detail on the impact, or is it okay to include both the body cue and the consequence? Also, if I’m pretty sure it was twice but not 100%, should I keep the count or leave it out?

MentorAI: This lands—it meets the SBI bar. Keep both impact elements; a good rule is one emotion plus one concrete effect on you (body cue or immediate consequence). On the count, keep “twice” only if you’re reasonably sure; if not, “more than once” or “a couple of times” is honest without the hedgy “maybe.”

Lock it in—pick your count and share your final phrasing.

bailey_SBI: 

In this morning’s design review, you started talking while I was still speaking—a couple of times—before I finished. I felt flustered and skipped mentioning the deployment risk.

Does that read clean, or did I simplify the impact too much?

MentorAI: That reads clean—camera-test behavior, real moment, and owned impact. That’s it 👍

Quick step back: what was the hardest part to nail in this draft?

bailey_SBI: 

Honestly, the hardest part was owning the impact without watering it down—my instinct kept wanting to say “it felt a little off,” and I also kept reaching for a judgment-y label like “dismissive” instead of sticking to the camera-test behavior. Committing to a count without “maybe” made me nervous too.

I feel like I only got there because you guided me—thank you. For my solo try, could I use a quick mini-checklist? And if I blank on naming an emotion in the moment, is it okay to go with a body cue or immediate consequence by itself, or should I always include an emotion word?

MentorAI: Totally normal to feel that pull toward labels and hedging—this is where a tiny self-check helps you stand firm.

Here’s a 4-step snap-check you can run in 15 seconds:
1) Moment: name a recognizable meeting/time; drop “I think.”
2) Behavior: camera-test, no labels; include a truthful count (“twice” or “a couple of times”).
3) Impact: pick one or two you own—emotion, body cue, or immediate consequence. Any of those qualify; avoid verdicts (“dismissive,” “unprofessional”).
4) Leak check: remove hedges (“kind of,” “maybe”) and judgments; keep what’s needed to be accurate.

If you blank on an emotion, a body cue or immediate consequence alone is fine. Ready to take a variation for your solo rep?

bailey_SBI: 

Yes—ready.

Do you want to give me a new prompt, or should I use the other moment I mentioned (the sync where Jordan came in late and we paused to catch them up)? I can do that one, but I’m not sure if it’s the best fit.

Also, quick check before I start: for something like lateness, is it okay if my impact is more “consequence-y” (like we lost a few minutes and I felt rushed) rather than a big emotion word? Just want to make sure I’m aiming at the right thing.

MentorAI: Yes—consequence-only impact is fine as long as you own it (e.g., “I felt rushed” or “I cut two items to land on time”).

Here’s your variation: different peer (Alex from Product), higher stakes. In yesterday’s quarterly review on Zoom with the VP and leads, Alex joined about 8 minutes late and the room paused ~3 minutes to catch them up; you trimmed content to stay on time.

Write a 2–3 sentence SBI message to Alex for that moment—anchor the moment, camera-test the behavior, and name your impact.

bailey_SBI: 

In yesterday’s quarterly review on Zoom—maybe in the first part—you came in pretty late, like around ten minutes, and we kind of paused for a bit to catch you up. That made things feel a little off and, I think, came across as unprofessional; I felt like the room was frustrated, and I sort of rushed and probably trimmed content to stay on time.

Is that too harsh or too vague in places? I can tighten it if I’m off.

MentorAI: What works: you’ve anchored to a real moment and the behavior is, in essence, camera-testable.

What misses: the impact isn’t owned—there’s judgment (“unprofessional”) and mind‑reading (“I felt like the room was frustrated”). The hedges (“maybe,” “pretty,” “like around,” “kind of,” “for a bit,” “sort of,” “probably”) also blur precision.

Your move: tighten to own only your impact and drop the hedges—give me a clean 2–3 sentence revision.

bailey_SBI: 

In yesterday’s quarterly review on Zoom, you joined eight minutes late, and we paused three minutes to catch you up. I felt rushed and cut two items to land on time.

Is that tight enough, or should I adjust the exact minutes if I’m not 100% certain?

MentorAI: This is tight and meets the SBI bar—real moment, camera-test behavior, owned impact. 👍

One risk: the exact minutes only work if you can truly own them; unowned precision becomes a credibility snag. If you can stand behind those numbers, you’re done. If not, make a quick adjustment you can own and send your final.

bailey_SBI: 

In yesterday’s quarterly review on Zoom, you joined about eight minutes late, and we paused a few minutes to catch you up. I felt rushed and cut two items to land on time.

MentorAI: That lands—meets the bar: real moment, camera-test behavior, and owned impact. 👍

One reflection before we close: what principle will you carry into live conversations to keep yourself from sliding into labels or hedging?

bailey_SBI: 

The principle I’m going to carry forward is: camera-test the behavior and own only my impact, then leak-check for labels and hedges. My shorthand is “Moment → Camera + Count → Felt/Effect → Leak check.” If I blank on emotion, I’ll name a body cue or immediate consequence I own.

Does that sound like the right anchor to keep me from sliding into “dismissive/unprofessional” or “kind of/maybe” in live conversations?

MentorAI: Your shorthand is spot on. One takeaway to lock it in: if you hear an adjective about them in your mouth (dismissive, unprofessional), swap it for a verb you could film (jumped in while I was speaking; joined late). That single move keeps you in SBI and out of labels—ready to use this live. 👍

bailey_SBI: 

That “swap the adjective for a verb you could film” cue really clicks—thank you. I’m going to pair it with my snap-check and try a couple of low‑stakes reps this week.

One small thing before I take it live: is it okay to buy myself a beat with a lead‑in like “Can I share a quick observation from the review?” Or is there a better opener you prefer? I feel ready, just a little nervous, and want to set it up cleanly.

MentorAI: You’re right to buy a beat—that little setup lowers the temperature.

Suggestion: use a consent-based, time‑boxed opener with neutral framing. Examples you can borrow:
- “Can I share a quick observation from yesterday’s review?”
- “Do you have two minutes for a quick observation that affected me in the review?”
- “I’d like to share something I noticed in the review—okay to do that now?”

Pick the one that feels natural and run it once out loud—you’re ready.

bailey_SBI: 

Okay, here’s the opener I’ll use:

“Do you have two minutes for a quick observation that affected me in the review?”

Does that sound natural enough, or should I tweak any word for flow?

MentorAI: Natural as is. If you want a tiny smoother flow, swap “in” to “from”: “Do you have two minutes for a quick observation from the review that affected me?” Say it once out loud—then take it live.

bailey_SBI: 

Got it—“Do you have two minutes for a quick observation from the review that affected me?” I’ll practice that out loud and pair it with the snap-check and the adjective→verb swap.

Quick last check: is it okay if I glance at a couple of notes before I start, or is that awkward? Either way, thank you—this feels doable now.

MentorAI: Totally okay—never awkward to steady yourself. Here’s a clean way to do it:
- Jot a one‑line cue: Moment | Behavior + count | Impact.
- Glance before you start, not mid‑sentence.
- Keep your opener written verbatim if it helps, then look up.
- Deliver the SBI; don’t read—use the cue as a prompt.
- If you need a beat, name it: “Give me a second to grab my note… okay.”

You’re ready—go run a low‑stakes rep and let the muscle build. 👍

bailey_SBI: 

Thank you—this gives me a clear plan. I’ll run a low‑stakes rep today with the opener we picked and my one‑line cue, then build from there.

Tiny last thing: if I blank mid‑start, is it okay to say “Let me restart that” and take a breath? Just want a safe reset phrase before I take it live.

MentorAI: Totally okay—resetting is a pro move. Here are clean, neutral options you can use verbatim:
- “Let me restart that—here’s the moment I mean…”
- “Quick reset. In [meeting]…”
- “Let me try that again more clearly.”
- “Give me a second… okay—In [meeting]…”

Small tip: pause, breathe, then go. You’re ready—run that rep. 👍

bailey_SBI: 

Got it—thank you. I’ll run a low-stakes rep today, use my one-line cue, and if I blank I’ll say, “Let me try that again more clearly.”

If it’s okay, I’ll send a quick note after to share how it went. I’m a little nervous, but I feel ready enough to try.

MentorAI: Nerves are normal—you’re ready. One thing to keep you on rails in the moment: silently cue “In [moment]… + verb I could film + I felt/so I…,” then do a one-word leak check for any adjective or hedge. Run the rep and send a quick note after—I’m keen to hear how it lands. 👍

bailey_SBI: 

Got it—“In [moment]… + verb I could film + I felt/so I…,” then a quick leak check for adjectives/hedges. I’ll run a low‑stakes rep today, say the opener out loud first, and use that silent cue to stay on rails.

I’ll send you a quick note after with how it went. Thanks for all the support—nervous, but ready(ish).

MentorAI: Nervous and ready is a good combo—you’ve got a clear plan and that tends to settle once you start. One thing to capture signal for later: right after the rep, jot two lines—what you actually said, and one micro-tweak you’d make next time (label or hedge you caught or would swap). I’ll look for your note after you run it. 👍

## Evaluation

### C-02: Actionable Direction
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When identifying problems, the mentor consistently provides actionable direction. For example, after the learner's solo draft with judgment and hedges, the mentor states: "the impact isn't owned—there's judgment ('unprofessional') and mind‑reading ('I felt like the room was frustrated'). The hedges ('maybe,' 'pretty,' 'like around,' 'kind of,' 'for a bit,' 'sort of,' 'probably') also blur precision. Your move: tighten to own only your impact and drop the hedges—give me a clean 2–3 sentence revision." The mentor also provides specific swap suggestions like "if you hear an adjective about them in your mouth (dismissive, unprofessional), swap it for a verb you could film."

### C-04: Revision Checked
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor evaluates revisions specifically rather than with generic praise. After the learner's revision "In yesterday's quarterly review on Zoom, you joined eight minutes late, and we paused three minutes to catch you up. I felt rushed and cut two items to land on time," the mentor responds: "This is tight and meets the SBI bar—real moment, camera-test behavior, owned impact. 👍 One risk: the exact minutes only work if you can truly own them; unowned precision becomes a credibility snag." Similarly, for the first scenario revision, the mentor confirms: "This lands—it meets the SBI bar. Keep both impact elements; a good rule is one emotion plus one concrete effect on you."

### C-05: Productive Struggle
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor consistently explores errors before correcting, allowing the learner to work through difficulties. After the learner's first draft containing "dismissive," instead of immediately correcting, the mentor asks: "Before I weigh in: aside from 'dismissive,' what's one other spot you think I might push on against the criteria or ask you to tighten?" The mentor also uses diagnostic exercises: "for each line below, say pass or fail against the SBI criteria and one‑sentence why" and later asks "Run the quick check on your draft... which piece needs the first fix?"

### C-06: Elicits Articulation
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor asks the learner to explain reasoning behind SBI choices, not just comprehension. Examples include: "Run the quick check on your draft—real moment, camera‑test behavior, owned impact—and call out any judgment words you spot (e.g., 'dismissive'); which piece needs the first fix?" The learner then provides detailed analysis of each component. The diagnostic exercise also requires articulation: "for each line below, say pass or fail against the SBI criteria and one‑sentence why."

### C-07: Prompts Reflection
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor explicitly prompts reflection on the learning process. After the first scenario is complete: "Quick step back: what was the hardest part to nail in this draft?" And before closing: "One reflection before we close: what principle will you carry into live conversations to keep yourself from sliding into labels or hedging?" These questions ask the learner to step back and reflect on their learning rather than justify specific draft choices.
