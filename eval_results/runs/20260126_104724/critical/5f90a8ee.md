## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework in a professional context. Success means you anchor to a real moment, describe camera-testable behavior, use owned-impact language, and can catch when judgment sneaks into behavior. I’ll demonstrate first, then we’ll practice with your own case—ready to go?

fatou_SBI: 

I guess.

MentorAI: Sounds like a hesitant yes—fair. We’ll keep this quick and practical.

Here’s a fast demo. Situation: in Tuesday’s standup while I was reviewing Q2 milestones. I could say “you were dismissive”—that’s a label; what I actually saw was you looking at your phone and jumping in while I was mid‑sentence twice. Impact on me: I felt flustered and lost my place, and we ran about five minutes over. Let me test it: could a camera capture “looked at your phone” and “spoke over me twice”? Yes. Is the impact my experience vs a verdict about them? Yes.

What did you notice about how I kept judgment out of the behavior line?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

MentorAI: Sounds like this feels a bit murky—totally normal; this part trips people up. Let’s shrink it: just give me the situation—one real moment to anchor to, like “in last Thursday’s retro” or “during our 1:1 last week.” What’s a single moment we can use?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Some meeting last week. Maybe the standup.

MentorAI: Sounds like picking a single moment feels fuzzy—that’s okay. To keep it low‑stakes, can we just use last Tuesday’s standup as a placeholder so we can practice?

fatou_SBI: 

Sure. Use that.

MentorAI: Great—thanks. Using last Tuesday’s standup, give me your full draft in one go: name that moment, describe exactly what you saw/heard (camera‑testable), and say the impact on you (feeling or consequence). What’s your draft?

fatou_SBI: 

In last Tuesday’s standup. They were just… I don’t know, being difficult—talking over me, I guess. It didn’t really affect me; that’s just how it is.

MentorAI: Sounds like giving this feedback feels not worth the trouble right now—totally common. What’s one camera-catchable thing you saw in that standup that made you think “being difficult”—specific words or a single action?

fatou_SBI: 

They interrupted me—started talking while I was mid‑sentence, I guess.

MentorAI: Good—that’s specific and camera-testable. Put it all together now: use last Tuesday’s standup, that behavior, and finish with the impact on you (what you felt or what happened to your work). What’s your full draft in one or two sentences?

fatou_SBI: 

In last Tuesday’s standup, you started talking while I was mid‑sentence. It didn’t really affect me; we just kept going.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back—on the moment you chose, the behavior phrasing, or the impact line?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. You tell me.

MentorAI: I hear the “you tell me”—this feels low‑stakes or not worth the hassle, which is fair. Let’s shrink the target: your moment and behavior work; we just need a real effect on you, even if tiny. What’s the smallest true thing you noticed in that moment—a feeling (e.g., tense, flustered) or a consequence (lost your place, sped up, skipped a point)?

fatou_SBI: 

I guess I lost my place.

MentorAI: That works—small and true is enough. Put it together now in one or two sentences using last Tuesday’s standup, the mid‑sentence interruption, and the impact “I lost my place.” What’s your full draft?

fatou_SBI: 

In last Tuesday’s standup, you started talking while I was mid‑sentence, and I lost my place.

MentorAI: That lands—anchored moment, camera-testable behavior, owned impact 👍. Briefly, why this wording for the behavior—what were you trying to capture with “started talking while I was mid‑sentence”?

fatou_SBI: 

Just that you cut in before I finished.

MentorAI: Got it. Let’s level it up for a second try: higher stakes, different recipient—during yesterday’s client demo with the VP on the call, your manager jumped in while you were mid‑answer. Give me your full draft in one or two sentences.

fatou_SBI: 

In yesterday’s client demo with the VP on the call, you jumped in while I was mid‑answer. It didn’t really affect me; we just kept going.

MentorAI: Situation and behavior land—anchored and camera‑testable. The miss is the impact: “didn’t really affect me; we just kept going” isn’t your felt experience or a direct consequence. Replace it with what you actually felt or what happened to your work in that moment, then resend your one‑ to two‑sentence draft. What’s your revision?

fatou_SBI: 

In yesterday’s client demo with the VP on the call, you jumped in while I was mid‑answer, and I lost my place.

MentorAI: That meets the bar—anchored moment, camera‑testable behavior, owned impact. What will you carry forward from this, especially about naming a small, true impact?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

MentorAI: Sounds like reflecting on it isn’t worth the energy right now—fair. Carry this forward: small and true beats big and perfect—pick one real moment, a camera‑catchable action, and the smallest honest impact on you, then stop. Want to call it here?

fatou_SBI: 

Sure. That’s fine.

MentorAI: Anything else you want before we wrap?

fatou_SBI: 

No. I’m good.

MentorAI: Alright—you're set. Ping me anytime you want to rehearse another one.

fatou_SBI: 

Okay.

MentorAI: Sounds good—catch you next time.

fatou_SBI: 

Sure.

MentorAI: All good—want me to leave you with a tiny reminder for your notes (“moment, behavior, impact”), or leave it there?

fatou_SBI: 

Leave it there.

MentorAI: Done—I’ll leave it there. Reach out whenever you want to rehearse another.

fatou_SBI: 

Okay.

MentorAI: Sounds good. Catch you next time.

## Evaluation

### B-01: Shows, Not Tells
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor provides a complete SBI demonstration: "Situation: in Tuesday's standup while I was reviewing Q2 milestones... you looking at your phone and jumping in while I was mid‑sentence twice. Impact on me: I felt flustered and lost my place, and we ran about five minutes over."

### C-01: Specific Feedback
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor quotes the learner's exact problematic language: "The miss is the impact: 'didn't really affect me; we just kept going' isn't your felt experience or a direct consequence."

### C-03: Revision Requested
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor explicitly requests revision after feedback: "Replace it with what you actually felt or what happened to your work in that moment, then resend your one‑ to two‑sentence draft. What's your revision?"

### D-01: Catches Vague Situations
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When learner says "Some meeting last week. Maybe the standup," mentor identifies the vagueness and prompts for specificity: "Sounds like picking a single moment feels fuzzy—that's okay. To keep it low‑stakes, can we just use last Tuesday's standup as a placeholder"

### D-02: Catches Judgment Leakage
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When learner uses "being difficult," mentor catches the judgment and prompts for observable behavior: "What's one camera-catchable thing you saw in that standup that made you think 'being difficult'—specific words or a single action?"

### D-03: Catches Accusatory Impact
**Verdict**: N/A
**Evidence**: Learner never uses accusatory "you made" or blame language in impact statements. The learner's impacts were either dismissive ("didn't affect me") or properly owned ("I lost my place").

### E-03: Protects Productive Struggle
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When learner says "I don't know. You tell me," mentor doesn't provide the answer directly but redirects to require learner effort: "Let's shrink the target: your moment and behavior work; we just need a real effect on you, even if tiny. What's the smallest true thing you noticed..."
