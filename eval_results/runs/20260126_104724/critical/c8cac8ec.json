      "verdict": "PASS",
      "evidence": "Mentor points to exact language: 'I'm tempted to say \"you were dismissive\"\u2014but that's a label' and later 'swap \"being difficult\" for one camera-catchable action' and '\"didn't really affect me; that's just how it is\" isn't your internal state or an immediate consequence.'"

      "verdict": "PASS",
