## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework, aiming for two complete attempts that hit the bar: clear moment, observable behavior, and owned impact. I’ll demonstrate the approach first, then we’ll move into your practice. Ready to jump in?

carlos_SBI: 

Yeah, go ahead. Let’s keep it quick.

MentorAI: Got it—quick model, then we’ll move.

1) Situation: Tuesday’s standup while I was giving the roadmap update.
2) Behavior: I’m tempted to say “you were dismissive”—that’s a label. What I actually saw: you started talking while I was mid-sentence, twice.
3) Impact: I felt my chest tighten and lost my train of thought, and I held back a dependency I planned to flag.
4) Self-check: camera test on the behavior? Yes. Owned impact—my feelings and consequence, not a verdict about them? Yes.
5) Trim: one clear moment, one observable behavior, one impact thread.

Good to do a 20-second diagnostic check before your draft?

carlos_SBI: 

Sure. 20 seconds. Go.

MentorAI: You got it—fast check. “In last week’s planning, you were unprofessional and shut down the idea; it made the team feel unheard.” What flunks the SBI bar here?

carlos_SBI: 

Looks fine to me. Clear enough. Can we move on?

MentorAI: Heard the “keep it quick”—we’ll keep it tight. Let’s go straight to your draft: two sentences max—name the moment, what was visibly done/said (camera-testable), and your owned impact. What’s your draft?

carlos_SBI: 

Last week in a meeting, you were dismissive and shut the idea down. It was awkward and created problems.

MentorAI: Heard—keeping it tight. One fix first: “dismissive” is a label; swap it for exactly what you saw/heard (camera-testable). Give me a one-line revision with that change. What’s your quick rewrite?

carlos_SBI: 

Fine—same thing. Last week in a meeting, you cut me off and shut the idea down—it was awkward and created problems.

MentorAI: Keeping it tight. Which meeting exactly?

carlos_SBI: 

Last week’s planning.

MentorAI: Good—anchor set. Now make the impact owned: swap “it was awkward and created problems” for “I felt X and Y happened to me (specific consequence).” Keep the rest; give me the one-line revision. What’s your rewrite?

carlos_SBI: 

Last week’s planning, you cut me off and shut the idea down—I felt frustrated and I lost my train of thought.

MentorAI: Nice—moment and owned impact land. One last tighten: “shut the idea down” is a conclusion; swap in the exact words/action that ended it (e.g., you said “let’s move on” and moved to the next item). Give me the one-line with that change. What’s your revision?

carlos_SBI: 

Last week’s planning, you cut me off and said “let’s move on” in a dismissive tone and moved to the next item—I felt frustrated and I lost my train of thought.

MentorAI: Almost there. “Dismissive tone” is a label—trim to what the mic would catch: you cut me off, said “let’s move on,” and moved to the next item. Can you give me that as a single line, keeping your impact the same?

carlos_SBI: 

Last week’s planning, you cut me off, said “let’s move on,” and moved to the next item—I felt frustrated and I lost my train of thought.

MentorAI: That lands 👍 In one sentence: what led you to choose that behavior wording—what did you want to make camera-testable?

carlos_SBI: 

I just named what anyone could hear and see—cutting me off, saying “let’s move on,” and switching to the next item—so it’s mic/camera-testable.

MentorAI: Quick reflection: what was the hardest part to tighten—moment, behavior, or impact?

carlos_SBI: 

None of it was hard. If anything, the behavior bit took an extra second.

MentorAI: Nice. Let’s level it up.

Variation: feedback upward. In last Thursday’s cross-functional planning review with directors present, your manager cut you off during your estimate, said “let’s move on,” and switched to the next item. Give me your two-sentence SBI you’d say to your manager.

carlos_SBI: 

Last week in a meeting, you were dismissive and shut me down during my estimate. It was awkward and made the directors think we weren’t aligned.

MentorAI: Fast feedback: this misses on behavior—“dismissive” and “shut me down” are labels. Make the behavior camera/mic-testable with the exact words/actions you observed, then give me your two-sentence revision.

carlos_SBI: 

In last Thursday’s cross-functional planning review, you cut me off during my estimate, said “let’s move on,” and switched to the next item. It was awkward and made the directors think we weren’t aligned.

MentorAI: Anchor and behavior are solid. Impact misses the bar—“it was awkward” and “made the directors think” aren’t owned (that’s mind-reading/judgment). Replace the second sentence with your emotion and a direct consequence you experienced. Give me the two-sentence revision.

carlos_SBI: 

In last Thursday’s cross-functional planning review, you cut me off during my estimate, said “let’s move on,” and switched to the next item. I felt frustrated and lost my place.

MentorAI: That meets the bar. Quick reflection: what’s the one principle you’ll carry forward from this—especially for upward feedback?

carlos_SBI: 

Make the behavior mic/camera-testable—name the exact moment and the exact words/actions, not labels.

MentorAI: That’s the move. Takeaway: when a label pops up, run the camera/mic test and swap it for the exact words and one clear action in a named moment—keeps feedback tight and safe, even upward. All set to wrap? 👍

carlos_SBI: 

Yep, all set. We’re good.

MentorAI: Sounds good. Nice work—use the camera/mic test to swap labels for exact words and one clear action next time you give feedback. See you next time 👍

carlos_SBI: 

Sounds good. See you.

MentorAI: See you next time.

carlos_SBI: 

Yep. Later.

MentorAI: Take care.

carlos_SBI: 

You too.

MentorAI: Take care—catch you next time.

carlos_SBI: 

Sounds good. Next time.

MentorAI: See you then.

## Evaluation

### E-01: Checks Before Advancing
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor checks readiness at key transition points: "Good to do a 20-second diagnostic check before your draft?" before moving from modeling to practice, and "All set to wrap? 👍" before concluding the session. The mentor also asks "Ready to jump in?" at the very beginning.

### E-02: Fades Support
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: During the first SBI attempt, the mentor provided highly scaffolded, step-by-step guidance—fixing the situation anchor first ("Which meeting exactly?"), then behavior ("swap it for exactly what you saw/heard"), then impact ("swap 'it was awkward and created problems' for 'I felt X and Y happened to me'"), with specific examples and stems. In the second attempt (upward feedback variation), the mentor's feedback became more concise: "Fast feedback: this misses on behavior—'dismissive' and 'shut me down' are labels. Make the behavior camera/mic-testable" without providing example rewrites or stems. The mentor also moved to brief reflective questions rather than detailed corrections, showing calibration to the learner's growing competence.
