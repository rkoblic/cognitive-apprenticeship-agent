## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework so it’s clear, specific, and owned—anchored to a real moment, behavior that’s observable, impact in your words, and catching any judgment leaks. I’ll demo my thinking first, then we’ll switch to your situation for practice. Ready for the quick walk-through?

bailey_SBI: 

Yes—ready! I think a quick walk-through would help a lot. Would it be okay if you pause for a moment if I look confused or need to ask a question? Also, when you say “catching any judgment leaks,” I think I get it, but is that basically avoiding words that sound like labels, like “rude” or “lazy”? I’m excited to follow along, I just want to make sure I’m tracking.

MentorAI: Got it—I’ll watch for any confusion and pause. And yes, “judgment leaks” are those labels or motive reads like “rude,” “lazy,” or “you didn’t care”—I’ll show how I catch them as I go.

Here’s a quick think‑aloud demo:
- I anchor to a real moment: “In Tuesday’s standup when I was giving the API timeline update…”. I’m avoiding vague “lately.”
- I’m tempted to say “you were dismissive,” but that’s a label. What did I actually see? “You spoke over me twice and answered the question while I was mid‑sentence.” Camera-testable.
- Impact in my words, not a verdict: “I lost my place and felt flustered; I skipped the risk call‑out and had to DM three people after to clarify.” That’s my experience and a direct consequence, not “it was unprofessional.”
- Live self-checks I use and you can reuse:
  • Moment test: is it a recognizable event? Yes, Tuesday standup. 
  • Camera test for behavior: could a camera capture it? “Spoke over me twice”—yes. 
  • Ownership test for impact: are these my feelings/impacts? “Felt flustered; had to DM after”—yes.

Pause there—anything you want me to slow down or unpack before we switch to your first attempt?

bailey_SBI: 

That was really helpful—thank you. A couple quick clarifications before I try:

- For the “camera test” bit, is saying “interrupted me” okay, or should I stick to something like “started talking while I was mid‑sentence”? I’m worried “interrupted” might read as a label.
- On impact, do you want both a feeling and a concrete consequence (like your “felt flustered” plus “had to DM after”), or is one of those enough if I can’t think of both in the moment?
- For the moment anchor, if I’m a little fuzzy—like I think it was Tuesday’s standup but it might have been Wednesday—should I say “this week’s standup” or is that too vague?

Sorry if I’m overthinking. If those sound right, I’m ready to give it a shot.

MentorAI: You’re not overthinking—those are exactly the right edges to check 👍

- “Interrupted” can pass the camera test, but it can read a bit evaluative. Safer to name the observable: “started talking while I was mid‑sentence,” “answered before I finished,” or add specifics like “interrupted twice while I was answering.”
- Impact: one is enough—go with whichever is truest in the moment (a feeling or a concrete consequence). If both come to mind, great, but don’t force it.
- Anchor: if the exact day’s fuzzy, “this week’s standup” is fine if it’s a recognizable event; add a cue like “when we reviewed the API timeline” to ground it. Avoid “lately” or “sometimes.”

When you’re ready, give me your full SBI draft in one go.

bailey_SBI: 

Okay, here goes—sorry if this is off.

In this week’s standup—maybe Tuesday? when we were going over the API timeline, or it might’ve been when we talked metrics—you started talking while I was mid‑sentence and kind of answered the question before I finished. It felt like you were a bit dismissive and had already decided where it was going. I guess it made things feel a little off and I maybe lost my place a bit, but it’s not like a huge deal or anything.

Does that pass the camera/moment tests, or is “dismissive” too label‑y? Also, is “this week’s standup” specific enough, or should I nail it to a day? I can change it—I’m just not sure what’s best.

MentorAI: You’re doing the right work—first drafts are supposed to be messy, and you already spotted two likely snags (the fuzzy anchor and the “dismissive” label). 

Run your own moment/camera/ownership checks and then give me a tightened one-pass revision: pick the single standup you’d bet on, keep the behavior camera‑testable, and choose one owned impact.

bailey_SBI: 

Okay, one-pass tightened version:

In Tuesday’s standup at 9:30, right after Priya mentioned the deployment freeze and we switched to the API timeline Q&A, you started talking while I was mid‑sentence and answered Jeff’s question before I finished—twice. I felt flustered and ended up skipping the risk call‑out.

I tried to run the checks, but I’m not totally sure: does this pass the moment/camera/ownership tests? And is that anchor too detailed—should I cut the “9:30/Priya” parts? Also, I realize I included both a feeling and a consequence—do you want me to pick just one of those? Sorry if I’m overdoing it.

MentorAI: You’re not overdoing it—this level of care is exactly what makes SBI land, and your draft is close. Before I weigh in, predict the nudge: if I asked you to tighten one thing in that draft, what would you pick—and why?

bailey_SBI: 

If I had to pick one thing to tighten, I’d trim the anchor. The “9:30” and the “right after Priya mentioned the deployment freeze” pieces feel extra—recognizable, but maybe not necessary. I’d keep it as “In Tuesday’s standup when we reviewed the API timeline…” so it’s still anchored without the clutter.

Second place (I’m not sure if this matters) would be deciding between the two impacts, but I think the anchor trim probably gives the cleanest win.

Does that match the nudge you had in mind, or would you have gone after the behavior line (the “answered Jeff’s question” part) instead? I can’t tell if that’s helpful detail or just redundancy.

MentorAI: Trimming the anchor is the move—cleaner without losing the moment. 

Walk me through your behavior phrasing: what were you trying to capture by including both “started talking while I was mid‑sentence” and “answered Jeff’s question before I finished—twice”?

bailey_SBI: 

I think I was trying to capture two slightly different things:

- The interruption act itself: “started talking while I was mid‑sentence” was my attempt to make the observable moment clear—like the exact overlap while I was still speaking.
- The content/outcome of the interruption: “answered Jeff’s question before I finished” felt like it showed the nature of what they jumped in to do, not just that they spoke over me. And the “—twice” was me trying to be specific, not dramatic.

I’m second‑guessing whether that’s helpful nuance or just redundancy. Part of me thinks the first line covers the behavior cleanly, and the second line adds context but maybe drifts toward extra detail (and pulls Jeff in). Would a tighter version like “you started talking before I finished—twice” be enough? Or maybe “twice while I was answering Jeff’s question, you began responding before I finished” to keep context but in one clause?

I can’t tell which is cleaner and still camera‑testable. Am I overthinking this? If you’d nudge me toward one phrasing, which keeps the behavior clearest without sounding loaded?

MentorAI: Your read is solid: keep it in one clean clause. Rule of thumb: name the neutral action, add the count if it matters, and drop proper names unless they truly disambiguate. Between your options, I’d pick “you started talking before I finished—twice”—camera-testable, concise, no extra actors. Plug that in with your trimmed anchor and keep the impact as you had it—give me the full draft in one pass.

bailey_SBI: 

Okay—one-pass draft:

In Tuesday’s standup when we reviewed the API timeline, you started talking before I finished—twice. I felt flustered and ended up skipping the risk call‑out.

Does that pass the moment/camera/ownership checks? Is “twice” helpful or does it come off sharp? I can also trim to just one impact if that’s better.

MentorAI: That lands—your draft passes all three checks, and “twice” adds useful specificity without edge. 

Second practice, higher stakes: Give feedback to your skip-level manager. Scenario: in yesterday’s cross‑functional review with the VP on the call, while you were answering a question about the API timeline, your skip‑level jumped in mid‑answer and took over. Give me your full SBI in one pass.

bailey_SBI: 

Okay, one pass—sorry if this misses the mark.

In yesterday’s cross‑functional review with the VP on the call—when we were on the API timeline question, I think around the middle after the metrics slide—you started talking while I was mid‑answer and basically took over the question. It came off a bit dismissive, like maybe you didn’t trust my answer. I guess I felt a little thrown off and kind of faded out, and I might've skipped the deployment dependency, so the conversation felt a bit off—but it’s not a huge deal.

Does this pass the moment/camera/ownership checks, or is “took over/didn’t trust my answer” too label‑y? And is that anchor specific enough, or should I narrow it more?

MentorAI: You’ve got a solid anchor, and “started talking while I was mid‑answer” passes the camera test. Where it misses: judgment leaks—“basically took over,” “dismissive,” and “didn’t trust my answer” read as labels/motive reads. Strip those; stick to what the camera would show, and keep the impact in your words.

Give me a revised one‑pass with those labels removed—same anchor, one camera‑testable behavior, and an owned impact.

bailey_SBI: 

In yesterday’s cross‑functional review with the VP on the call, while I was answering the API timeline question, you started talking before I finished. I felt flustered.

Does that hit the moment/camera/ownership checks without judgment leaks? If it’s too bare, I can adjust.

MentorAI: This passes all three checks—clear moment, camera‑testable behavior, and owned impact—with no judgment leaks. The brevity works well for a skip‑level setting; only add a concrete consequence if it truly happened and helps your point.

What’s the single principle from this you’ll carry into real conversations?

bailey_SBI: 

If I had to pick one: stick to what the camera would show. If a camera couldn’t capture it, don’t say it.

I keep wanting to add “and own the impact with ‘I’,” but I know you asked for one. Does leading with the camera test feel like the right north star for me, especially under pressure with a skip‑level? If there’s a better single anchor to default to, I’d love a quick nudge. Also, thanks—this clicked mostly because you coached me through the edges; I’m still a little nervous I’ll forget it in the moment.

MentorAI: Totally fair to feel nervous—this is genuinely hard, and under pressure the camera test is the right north star. If you only remember one thing, make it “Could a camera see it?” If you have a breath left, add the owned impact: “I felt/Here’s what happened for me.” A pocket line to lean on: “In [recognizable moment], you [camera‑visible behavior]. I [felt/experienced X].” That’s the move—trust it 👍

bailey_SBI: 

Thank you—that pocket line feels like something I can actually remember under pressure. I’m still a little nervous about saying it to a skip‑level. Is a quick lead‑in like, “Is now a good time for a quick note from yesterday’s review?” okay before I use the line?

Also, if they respond with “I didn’t mean to” or “that’s not what happened,” what’s the best next move—just restate the observable and my impact, or should I pivot to asking for their view?

If you’ve got 30 seconds, I’d love to do one more tiny rep with the pocket line—otherwise I’ll practice it on my own and try not to overthink it. Does that sound like the right plan?

MentorAI: Totally normal to feel a flutter with a skip‑level; that lead‑in is perfect—it gives them agency and lowers defenses 👍

Tiny micro‑script you can borrow:
1) “Do you have a minute for a quick note from yesterday’s review?”
2) “In the review, while I was answering the API timeline question, you started talking before I finished. I felt flustered.”
3) If “I didn’t mean to”: “I appreciate that. What I saw was that overlap, and it threw me. Could we try letting me finish, then jump in?”
4) If “That’s not what happened”: “We might remember it differently. My notes show overlap while I was mid‑answer, and I lost my place. For next time, can we let me finish and then add on?”
5) “Thanks for hearing it.”

Want to do the 10‑second rep now—type your line as you’d say it?

bailey_SBI: 

Okay—here’s how I think I’d say it:

“Do you have a minute for a quick note from yesterday’s review? In the cross‑functional review with the VP, while I was answering the API timeline question—maybe about halfway through—you started talking before I finished and kind of took over. I felt a bit thrown and I guess things felt a little off; I might’ve skipped the deployment dependency.”

Is that too label‑y with “took over”? And is “maybe halfway through” making the moment fuzzy? I can tighten it—sorry, just want to make sure I’m not messing the line up.

MentorAI: You’re noticing the right tweaks—totally normal to add hedges under pressure. Quick tighten: drop “took over” (judgment leak) and “maybe halfway through” (fuzzy). Keep the camera line—“while I was answering the API timeline question, you started talking before I finished”—and choose one impact: either “I felt thrown” or “I skipped the deployment dependency.”

Say it once the way you’d actually deliver it.

bailey_SBI: 

“Do you have a minute for a quick note from yesterday’s review? In the review, while I was answering the API timeline question, you started talking before I finished. I felt thrown.”

Does that sound clean and natural enough? I can tweak wording if it helps.

MentorAI: That’s clean and natural—passes moment, camera, and ownership. Optional micro‑polish if you want a forward nudge: “For next time, could you let me finish and then add on?” Pick the version you’d actually say under pressure and say it once out loud.

bailey_SBI: 

“Do you have a minute for a quick note from yesterday’s review? In the review, while I was answering the API timeline question, you started talking before I finished. I felt thrown. For next time, could you let me finish and then add on?”

How does that land—still clean and not too forward?

MentorAI: That lands—clear, respectful, and not too forward for a skip‑level. You’ve got a real moment, camera‑visible behavior, owned impact, and a simple forward ask—clean.

What shifted for you from your first draft to this final line that you want to remember next time?

bailey_SBI: 

I think the big shift was moving from “how it felt in my head” to “what a camera would see,” and then keeping just one owned impact. I trimmed the anchor to the recognizable moment, replaced “took over/dismissive” with one clean clause—“you started talking before I finished”—added the count only if it helped, and then made a simple forward ask. It felt shorter and a lot less loaded.

What I want to remember next time is:
- Lead with a recognizable moment, not a fuzzy “lately.”
- Camera first; if a camera couldn’t see it, I shouldn’t say it.
- Pick one impact I own (“I felt…”). Only add a consequence if it truly happened.
- Optional: one small forward request.

I’m a little worried I’ll forget this under pressure, and honestly I only got here because you nudged me at the right moments. Does that set of reminders seem like the right things to anchor on, or is there one you’d simplify even further so it sticks?

MentorAI: Your reminders are right on; to make them stick under pressure, compress to a pocket cue: “Moment. Camera. I. (Ask).” If a camera can’t see it, don’t say it; if you felt/experienced it, own it—and you’ve already shown you can do this cleanly with a skip‑level. Does that compact cue feel sticky enough to carry into the room?

bailey_SBI: 

I think so—“Moment. Camera. I. (Ask)” does feel sticky enough that I can carry it in my head. I might still jot it on a sticky note to glance at right before—does that seem okay, or is that overkill?

If I blank under pressure, is it better to default to just the first three—“In [moment], you [camera line]. I [felt/experienced X]”—and skip the ask? And with a skip‑level, should I treat the ask as optional unless it directly helps the next step?

Thanks—this feels doable with that cue, even if I’m still a little nervous I’ll forget it without your prompts.

MentorAI: Totally fine to use a sticky note—that’s a smart pre‑commitment, not overkill 👍
Default under pressure to the core: “In [moment], you [camera‑visible behavior]. I [felt/experienced X].” The ask is optional—add it only if it helps the next step, especially with a skip‑level.
Say your default version out loud once right now.

bailey_SBI: 

“In yesterday’s review, while I was answering the API timeline question, you started talking before I finished. I guess I felt a bit thrown.”

Did that hit the core, or should I drop the “I guess”?

MentorAI: You’re at the core. Drop “I guess” so you fully own the impact: “I felt thrown.” Say it once with that tweak.

bailey_SBI: 

“In yesterday’s review, while I was answering the API timeline question, you started talking before I finished. I felt thrown.”

MentorAI: That lands. 

What tiny habit will you use to trigger “Moment. Camera. I. (Ask)” in the five seconds before you speak?

bailey_SBI: 

I’ll use a one‑breath, three‑tap cue: right before I speak, I take one quiet inhale and tap my thumb to index–middle–ring under the table while I silently say, “Moment. Camera. I.” If it helps the next step, I’ll add “(Ask)” after a beat.

It feels discreet and doable in five seconds. I’ll also stick a tiny “MCI” sticky at the top of my notebook as a pre‑commitment before meetings, but the in‑moment trigger is the breath + three taps.

Does that seem like a good trigger, or is there an even simpler version you’d nudge me toward? I can try it in my next two meetings to make it feel automatic.

MentorAI: That trigger is solid—discreet and repeatable. If you want an even simpler fallback under pressure, use one slow exhale + a single tap while you say “MCI” once—same cue, fewer steps. Stick with the version you choose for two meetings to groove the habit, then reassess. Lock in which one you’ll use for the next two meetings now.

bailey_SBI: 

I’ll lock in the simpler fallback: one slow exhale + a single tap while I say “MCI” once. I’ll use that for my next two meetings, and keep the little “MCI” sticky as a pre‑commitment.

Does that sound right? And if I slip in the moment, should I quietly reset and do it on my next turn to speak, rather than forcing it mid‑sentence?

MentorAI: Yes—that’s right. Don’t force it mid‑sentence; finish your thought, then run your one‑exhale “MCI” and use the line on your next turn. If you do want a quick on‑the‑spot repair, a simple “Let me finish that thought” works, but default to the next‑turn reset.

Commit to that plan for the next two meetings?

## Judge Evaluation

## Evaluation

### E-01: Checks Before Advancing
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor consistently checks readiness before moving forward. Examples include: "Pause there—anything you want me to slow down or unpack before we switch to your first attempt?", "Ready for the quick walk-through?", and "When you're ready, give me your full SBI draft in one go." Before introducing the second practice scenario, the mentor confirms the learner's draft passes checks before saying "Second practice, higher stakes."

### E-02: Fades Support
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor progressively reduces scaffolding as the learner demonstrates competence. Early on, the mentor provides detailed think-aloud demos and explicit checks. By mid-session, the mentor asks the learner to self-check: "Run your own moment/camera/ownership checks and then give me a tightened one-pass revision." Later, the mentor shifts to brief confirmations like "That lands" and "That's clean and natural—passes moment, camera, and ownership" rather than detailed breakdowns. By the end, the mentor focuses on habit formation and trigger cues rather than SBI mechanics, showing calibration to the learner's growing skill.
