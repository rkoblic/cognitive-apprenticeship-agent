## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on giving peer feedback using the SBI frame. Success is: a real moment anchored in time, an observable behavior (camera-testable), and impact in your own words (your feeling or direct consequence). I’ll demo the approach next—ready for that?

amara_SBI: 

Yep, I’m ready. I haven’t used this framework before, so a demo would help.

MentorAI: Great—here’s a quick think-aloud demo so you can see the moves. I’ll pick a concrete moment: Tuesday’s standup when I was giving my API update. Tempting to say “you were dismissive”—but that’s a label. What did I actually see? You started talking while I was mid-sentence twice and turned to Sam to ask, “Did you push to prod?” while I was still speaking. For impact, I’ll keep it owned: I felt flustered and rushed; I lost my train of thought and skipped mentioning my blocker, so we had to circle back after.

Self-check live: camera-test on the behavior—could a camera capture “spoke while I was mid-sentence twice” and “turned to Sam and asked X”? Yes. Impact—are those my feelings and direct consequences? Yes. Avoided verdicts like “unprofessional.” So my SBI sounds like: “In Tuesday’s standup during my API update, you started talking while I was mid-sentence twice and asked Sam, ‘Did you push to prod?’ while I was still speaking. I felt flustered and rushed, lost my train of thought, and skipped my blocker, so we had to circle back after.”

Tools to reuse: moment anchor, camera-test for behavior, owned-impact check. What, if anything, would you copy from that when you try your own?

amara_SBI: 

I’d copy anchoring it to a specific moment like “Tuesday’s standup,” then describe what I saw/heard in camera-test terms. I’d also keep the impact owned—how I felt or what got missed—and do that quick self-check at the end.

MentorAI: Quick check before we practice: Does this behavior pass the camera test—why or why not? “In Monday’s retro, you were dismissive of my point.” If it fails, give a one-line camera-test rewrite.

amara_SBI: 

Yeah, I think it passes—the timing is clear and it’s straightforward. It sounds specific enough to me.

MentorAI: Let’s tighten that: try a one-line rewrite for Monday’s retro that a camera could capture—no labels, just exactly what you saw/heard that led you to “dismissive.” Go ahead and draft it.

amara_SBI: 

In Monday’s retro, you rolled your eyes and were clearly uninterested, saying “it’s not a big deal” while I was explaining my point.

MentorAI: What did you actually see that made you think “uninterested”? Rewrite the line using only those camera-capturable details.

amara_SBI: 

In Monday’s retro, while I was explaining my point, you rolled your eyes and said, “It’s not a big deal.”

MentorAI: Your turn—pick a real moment from your own work (e.g., this past week’s meeting), then write your full feedback in one go: the moment anchor, exactly what you saw/heard (camera-test), and your impact (how you felt or what happened). Keep it to 2–3 sentences. Drop your draft when you’re ready.

amara_SBI: 

In our standups lately, you’ve been dismissive of my updates and kept cutting me off like you didn’t really care what I was saying. You made the meeting awkward and threw the team off, and we ended up wasting time because of it.

MentorAI: What’s one spot you think I’ll push back on in this draft?

amara_SBI: 

I think it’s mostly fine—maybe the wording “you made the meeting awkward” could be softened a bit, but otherwise it seems okay.

MentorAI: Run the three-part self-check on your draft: 
- Moment anchor—does it point to one recognizable instance?
- Behavior—camera-test only?
- Impact—owned language (I felt/I experienced or a direct consequence you had)?
Mark each pass/fail with a one‑line reason and drop it in.

amara_SBI: 

- Moment anchor — Pass: It names our standups lately, so the timing/context feels clear enough.
- Behavior — Pass: It describes what you did—cutting me off and being dismissive—things I noticed in the moment.
- Impact — Fail: It starts with “You made…,” which isn’t owned; I should say how I felt or what I experienced.

MentorAI: Which single standup are you anchoring to—name the day (e.g., “yesterday’s standup”) so it’s one recognizable moment?

amara_SBI: 

It’s been in our standups this week—like the last couple of meetings.

MentorAI: Patterns are real—but for SBI we need one moment. Between the last two standups, which had the clearest instance of them cutting you off mid-sentence? Name that day so we can lock the anchor.

amara_SBI: 

Wednesday’s standup.

MentorAI: Good—Wednesday’s standup it is. Draft the feedback in 2–3 sentences: start with that moment, describe exactly what you saw/heard in camera-test terms (no labels like “dismissive”), and finish with your owned impact (how you felt or what consequence you experienced). Drop it in when you’re ready.

amara_SBI: 

In Wednesday’s standup during my update, you started talking while I was mid-sentence twice and turned to Alex to ask, “Is the dashboard updated?” while I was still talking. I felt flustered and rushed and lost my place; I skipped mentioning my blocker and had to circle back at the end.

MentorAI: What made you choose “mid-sentence twice” and include the exact quote to Alex—what were you trying to make unmistakable with those details?

amara_SBI: 

I wanted it to be unmistakable that you were talking over me while I was still speaking and that it happened more than once—hence “mid-sentence twice.” Quoting what you said to Alex pins the exact moment and shows the conversation got redirected away from my update while I was still talking.

MentorAI: You’re ready for a higher‑stakes variation. Scenario: yesterday’s client demo on Zoom with Acme, your manager cut in while you were mid‑answer and then turned to Dana and asked, “Can you pull up the metrics?” Draft your 2–3 sentence feedback to your manager—the moment anchor, camera-test behavior, and your owned impact—can you write it now?

amara_SBI: 

In our client demos lately on Zoom, you’ve been cutting me off and taking over answers in a way that felt dismissive. You made the call confusing and undermined me in front of the client, and we lost credibility because of it.

MentorAI: Not there yet. The anchor misses the bar—“in our client demos lately” isn’t one recognizable moment. Use the specific one: “yesterday’s client demo with Acme on Zoom.” Update your draft with that as the opener, keep the rest the same for now, and paste it back.

amara_SBI: 

In yesterday’s client demo with Acme on Zoom, you’ve been cutting me off and taking over answers in a way that felt dismissive. You made the call confusing and undermined me in front of the client, and we lost credibility because of it.

MentorAI: Anchor lands—“yesterday’s client demo with Acme on Zoom” is clear. The behavior line doesn’t pass: “you’ve been… felt dismissive” is a pattern plus a label; stick to the one moment and name what a camera would catch (you cut in while I was mid‑answer and then turned to Dana and asked, “Can you pull up the metrics?”). The impact isn’t owned—drop the verdicts (“undermined,” “lost credibility”) and name your felt experience or direct consequence for you.

Revise end‑to‑end in 2–3 sentences with that same anchor and send your next draft.

amara_SBI: 

In yesterday’s client demo with Acme on Zoom, you cut in while I was mid‑answer and then turned to Dana and asked, “Can you pull up the metrics?” I felt flustered and rushed, lost my train of thought, and shortened my answer; I had to circle back later to clarify.

MentorAI: That lands—clean SBI: specific anchor, camera‑test behavior, and owned impact. What’s one principle you’ll carry forward into future feedback? 👍

amara_SBI: 

Describe only what a camera would capture—no labels or judgments.

MentorAI: Takeaway: when a judgment word pops up (dismissive, undermined), pause and ask, “What did I actually see or hear?”—then swap in the quote, action, or count. Want to jot that as your cue for next time?

amara_SBI: 

Cue for next time: If I catch a judgment word (e.g., dismissive/undermined), ask “What did I actually see or hear?” and replace it with the exact quote, action, or count.

MentorAI: That cue nails the habit—spot the judgment, swap in what the camera would see. Anything else you want to capture before we wrap?

amara_SBI: 

One more: lock to a single, recognizable moment (“yesterday’s X”) and state the impact in owned terms (“I felt…” or a direct consequence for me). That’s it for me.

MentorAI: Locked in. Those two cues—single moment and camera-test with owned impact—will keep your SBI tight. Want to call it there?

amara_SBI: 

Yep, we can call it there. I’ll use those two cues next time.

MentorAI: Nice work—your SBI is crisp: single moment, camera-test behavior, owned impact. When you write your next one, which cue will you check first?

amara_SBI: 

I’ll check the single, recognizable moment first—make sure I’ve anchored it to “yesterday’s X” before I draft the rest.

MentorAI: Perfect. Lead with the moment—if you can name “yesterday’s X,” the behavior and owned impact usually write themselves. You’re set—go use it 👍

## Evaluation

### C-02: Actionable Direction
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor consistently provides actionable guidance, not just identification of problems. For example: "The behavior line doesn't pass: 'you've been… felt dismissive' is a pattern plus a label; stick to the one moment and name what a camera would catch (you cut in while I was mid‑answer and then turned to Dana and asked, 'Can you pull up the metrics?')." Also: "try a one-line rewrite for Monday's retro that a camera could capture—no labels, just exactly what you saw/heard."

### C-04: Revision Checked
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor evaluates revisions with specific commentary. Example: "That lands—clean SBI: specific anchor, camera‑test behavior, and owned impact." Also provides detailed evaluation: "Anchor lands—'yesterday's client demo with Acme on Zoom' is clear. The behavior line doesn't pass... The impact isn't owned—drop the verdicts ('undermined,' 'lost credibility') and name your felt experience."

### C-05: Productive Struggle
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor explores errors before correcting. When learner incorrectly claims "dismissive" passes the camera test, mentor doesn't immediately correct but asks: "What did you actually see that made you think 'uninterested'? Rewrite the line using only those camera-capturable details." Also prompts self-assessment: "What's one spot you think I'll push back on in this draft?" and "Run the three-part self-check on your draft."

### C-06: Elicits Articulation
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor asks learner to explain reasoning behind specific SBI choices: "What made you choose 'mid-sentence twice' and include the exact quote to Alex—what were you trying to make unmistakable with those details?" Also: "What, if anything, would you copy from that when you try your own?"

### C-07: Prompts Reflection
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor asks learner to step back and reflect on their learning: "What's one principle you'll carry forward into future feedback?" and "When you write your next one, which cue will you check first?" These questions prompt reflection on the learning process and principles to carry forward, not just justification of specific draft choices.
