## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re going to practice giving peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success looks like you producing two complete attempts that hit a specific moment, camera-testable behavior (no labels), and your owned impact. I’ll demonstrate my thinking first, then we’ll use one of your real situations—ready to start?

elise_SBI: 

Yes—ready to start, I think. Just to check I’m understanding: by “camera-testable behavior,” you mean something literally observable or audible—like “you started speaking while I was mid-sentence,” not a label like “you were dismissive,” right? And for impact, use “I” statements that I own.

I’m happy to follow your demo. Do you want me to just listen first, or should I try to note a real situation of mine in parallel while you go? Also, since success is two complete attempts, would it be okay if we pause after each part so I can make sure I’m tracking? Sorry if that’s overkill—I just want to make sure I’m doing it correctly.

MentorAI: You’ve got the idea exactly—camera-testable like “you started speaking while I was mid-sentence,” and impact in owned “I” language. And no worries about pacing; it’s smart to pause. Feel free to jot notes while I demo, but don’t draft yet—we’ll stop right after.

Here’s a quick think-aloud model:
- I’m anchoring to a real moment: in Tuesday’s standup when I was sharing the Q4 timeline. I’m choosing that over “lately” so it’s easy to recognize.
- I’m tempted to say “you were dismissive”—that’s a label. What did a camera pick up? Twice, you started talking while I was mid-sentence, and you looked at your phone while I was answering a question.
- My impact—owned language: I felt flustered and smaller in the room; my heart sped up; I cut my update short and didn’t raise the integration risk I needed help with.
- Quick self-checks I’ll reuse: camera test (could a camera capture those actions? yes), owned-impact (are these my feelings/choices? yes), judgment-leak scan (did I sneak in a verdict? I removed “dismissive”—good).

Put together: In Tuesday’s standup while I was sharing the Q4 timeline, you started talking while I was mid-sentence twice and looked at your phone while I was answering. I felt flustered and rushed—my heart sped up—and I cut my update short, which meant I didn’t surface the integration risk.

What do you want me to replay or clarify before we switch to your first attempt?

elise_SBI: 

That walkthrough made a lot of sense… I think. A couple of tiny things I’m unsure about before I try:

- On behavior granularity: is it okay to include two behaviors in one SBI (interrupting and checking the phone), or is it better to pick the highest-impact one so it doesn’t feel like a pile-on?
- For wording, “looked at your phone” passes the camera test, but should it be even more concrete, like “looked down at your phone and typed,” or is that overdoing it? Also, saying “twice” for the interruptions—does counting help specificity or risk sounding a bit accusatory?
- For impact, phrases like “I felt smaller in the room” and physiological cues like “my heart sped up”—are those good, or should I stick to more straightforward “I felt flustered and rushed”? I’m worried the metaphor might be too interpretive.

If that all sounds fine, should I start with anchoring my situation and pause for a quick check before moving to behavior? I don’t want to get ahead of myself.

MentorAI: You’re asking exactly the right level of precision—totally normal at this stage. Quick rule of thumb: include the minimum behavior needed to make your impact make sense—often one, sometimes two if they happened in the same moment and are additive; details like “twice” can help anchor without piling on. Let’s skip piece-by-piece and have you do one full draft from a real moment—we’ll refine after.

Go ahead and give me your full SBI now.

elise_SBI: 

Okay, I’ll try a full pass—if this isn’t the right kind of moment, I can switch.

In yesterday’s cross-functional standup at 9:30 in the main hub, while I was sharing the vendor rollout plan, you started speaking while I was mid-sentence twice, and you began typing on your laptop while I was answering a question about the timeline. I felt deflated and rushed—my chest tightened—and I lost my place and cut the update short, so I didn’t bring up the dependency risks I was hoping to get feedback on.

Does that land the way it should? I’m not sure if “started speaking while I was mid-sentence” is too loaded—should I say “began talking while I was still talking” or is that splitting hairs? And is “twice” helpful or does it sound a bit accusatory? Also, the “typing on your laptop” part—maybe that was just note-taking, so should I leave it out and focus on the interruption? And for impact, is “deflated” too interpretive compared to “I felt frustrated”? I can revise if you think I should narrow it to one behavior or tone down the language.

MentorAI: You’re not overdoing it—this level of precision is the work. Before I weigh in, run your self-check on your draft: camera test each behavior, confirm the impact is fully owned “I” language, and scan for any judgment leaks—what passes and what feels wobbly?

elise_SBI: 

Okay, here’s my self-check:

- Camera test:
  - “You started speaking while I was mid-sentence twice” — I think a camera/mic would capture that. That feels solid to me, unless “mid-sentence” somehow reads as interpretive? It’s literal, though… right?
  - “You began typing on your laptop while I was answering a question” — also camera-testable. The only wobble is that typing could have been note-taking; I’m not saying that, but I worry it reads as a verdict about attention.

- Owned impact:
  - “I felt deflated and rushed—my chest tightened—and I lost my place and cut the update short, so I didn’t bring up the dependency risks.” That’s all “I” language and my choices. Part of me wonders if “deflated” is a bit metaphorical or if “rushed” could imply you rushed me, even though I said “I felt.” Is that nitpicking?

- Judgment-leak scan:
  - I didn’t use labels like “dismissive.” The verbs are pretty neutral: “started speaking,” “began typing.” No “you made me…” language.
  - Possible tiny leak: including two behaviors might feel like a pile-on, and “twice” could come off as tallying infractions—even though you said counting can help anchor.

Overall, I think it mostly passes, but those are the bits that feel wobbly to me. Would you want me to keep both behaviors since they were in the same moment, or trim to the interruption only? And should I keep “twice,” or is that overemphasizing? I can adjust either way if that’s better.

MentorAI: If you had to keep only one behavior to make your stated impact make sense, which would you keep—and why does that one connect most directly to you feeling rushed, losing your place, and cutting the update short?

elise_SBI: 

If I had to keep just one, I’d keep “you started speaking while I was mid-sentence.” That one seems to connect most directly to me feeling rushed and losing my place—my train of thought got broken right then, which is what led me to cut the update short. The laptop typing feels more like it explains “deflated,” but it doesn’t quite cause the rushed/lost-place part as clearly.

Is “started speaking while I was mid-sentence” okay wording, or does “interrupted me” read cleaner without sounding judgy? And should I keep “twice” to anchor it, or is that overemphasizing?

If you think that choice makes sense, do you want me to rewrite the SBI with just that one behavior, or should I wait for your tweaks first?

MentorAI: You’re reading it well, and your choice tracks. Go with the concrete phrasing—“you started speaking while I was mid-sentence”—over “interrupted me”; it’s cleaner, camera-testable, and avoids a label. Let’s keep the scope tight: revise your full SBI with just that one behavior; don’t worry about perfect wording beyond that yet.

Share the revised version when you’ve got it.

elise_SBI: 

Here’s a tightened version with just the one behavior:

In yesterday’s 9:30 cross-functional standup in the main hub, while I was sharing the vendor rollout plan, you started speaking while I was mid-sentence twice. I felt rushed and flustered—my chest tightened—and I lost my place and cut the update short, which meant I didn’t raise the dependency risks I needed feedback on.

Does that hit the mark more cleanly? I kept “twice” to anchor it, but is that helpful or does it sound like I’m tallying? And I swapped “deflated” for “flustered” since we trimmed the laptop-typing piece—does that read better, or am I over-editing? I can do another pass if you think I should.

MentorAI: That lands—clean, camera-testable, and the “twice” anchors without reading as tallying here. For your second attempt, raise the stakes: draft a full SBI you’d give to your manager about Monday’s client steering committee on Zoom where, during your timeline update, they started speaking while you were mid-sentence; write it as you’d say it in your 1:1. Go ahead.

elise_SBI: 

Okay—here’s how I think I’d say it in my 1:1:

In Monday’s client steering committee on Zoom, during my timeline update when I was outlining the integration milestones, you started speaking while I was mid-sentence. I felt flustered and rushed—my heart sped up—and I lost my place. I ended up skipping the risk section and didn’t share the API dependency I needed input on.

Does that read as appropriately respectful for a manager? I wasn’t sure if I should soften it with a preface like “I might be misreading this,” or if that undercuts the clarity. Also, is “mid-sentence” okay, or does it sound a bit accusatory? I didn’t note how many times it happened—should I leave out a count like this, or try to estimate? I can revise the tone if you think it needs to be gentler.

MentorAI: You’re right to be mindful of tone with a manager; this version holds that line well 👍. It meets the bar: specific moment, camera-testable behavior, and fully owned impact with a clear consequence. You don’t need a softening preface—those usually dilute clarity; “mid-sentence” is descriptive, not accusatory, and only add a count if it helps show a pattern that matters to your impact.

Looking ahead, what’s the one principle from this you’ll carry into future feedback to a manager versus a peer?

elise_SBI: 

Thank you—that’s reassuring to hear. I honestly think your prompts made it feel a lot clearer than it usually does for me.

If I had to pick one principle I’d carry into feedback to a manager versus a peer, I think it would be: keep it ultra-specific and owned, and tie the impact to the work or decision-making outcome rather than their intent. So for a manager, one camera-testable behavior plus “I felt/then I did” that connects to a business consequence (missed risk, slowed decision). With a peer, I might still use the same structure but allow a bit more of the relational impact (how it affected our collaboration) without getting label-y.

Does that distinction make sense, or am I oversimplifying it? Part of me worries I’m downplaying the human side too much with a manager. Would it help if I try to turn that into a one-line checklist for myself, or should we do another quick practice to make sure it sticks?

MentorAI: Your distinction lands: with a manager, lead with the concrete moment, one observable behavior, and your owned impact tied to the work; with a peer, you can surface a bit more of the relational effect—still owned, not about intent. You’re not downplaying the human side; one clean feeling word is plenty, and linking to the consequence does the heavy lifting.

Takeaway to keep: one moment + one camera-visible behavior + one owned impact that connects to a concrete consequence; add a count only if it clarifies. Anything else you want to sanity-check before we wrap?

elise_SBI: 

This has been really helpful—I feel like your structure made it click more than usual for me. I still have a couple of small sanity-checks, if that’s okay:

- Timing: if the moment happens in a live meeting with my manager, is it better to give the SBI right after the meeting, or is a quick “let me finish this thought” in the moment appropriate? I don’t want it to feel confrontational in front of others.
- Adding a brief request: after the SBI, is it okay to add a single, practical ask like, “Could you hold questions until I finish the timeline section?” Or is that too pushy upward?
- Zoom specifics: for camera-test language on Zoom, is phrasing like “you started speaking while I was mid-sentence” still best, or should I reference something like “you came off mute and began talking while I was mid-sentence”? That feels a bit clunky.
- Feeling word choice with a manager: are words like “rattled” or “flustered” safer than “frustrated,” or am I over-optimizing?

If those sound fine, would you prefer I try one ultra-brief final rep to cement it, or should I write a one-line sticky-note checklist and read it back to you to make sure I captured it correctly? I’m happy to do either—whatever you think would help me not backslide.

MentorAI: All fair sanity-checks—you’re not over-optimizing. Keep it simple with this micro-rule set:
- Timing: protect the turn in-meeting if needed (“Let me finish this thought”) and give the SBI 1:1 soon after.
- Add one practical ask after SBI—totally appropriate upward.
- Zoom phrasing: “you started speaking while I was mid-sentence” is clean; no need to add “came off mute.”
- Feeling word: pick one plain, professional term (flustered/rattled/frustrated all work); don’t stack them.

Your move: write your one-line sticky-note checklist in your own words and read it back.

elise_SBI: 

Sticky note (in my words): One moment + one camera-test behavior + “I felt/then I did” owned impact tied to a concrete consequence (add count only if it clarifies) + one practical ask.

I think that captures it, but is that too crowded for a sticky note? Should I swap “camera-test” for “camera-visible” or simplify more? I can trim it down if you’d prefer something even tighter.

MentorAI: Tighten it to something you’ll actually scan in 2 seconds—use “observable” instead of “camera-test.” Try: Moment + one observable behavior + my impact (I felt/then I did) + concrete consequence + one ask. 

Write the version you’d actually put on a sticky and read it back.

elise_SBI: 

Sticky note: Moment + 1 observable behavior + my impact (I felt/then I did) + concrete consequence + 1 ask.

Does that feel short enough to actually scan, or did I trim it too much? Should I swap “concrete consequence” for “work impact” to make it clearer? If this reads right to you, I’ll stick it on my monitor—unless you think one more tiny tweak would help.

MentorAI: Short enough to scan. Keep “concrete consequence” over “work impact”—it’s crisper and keeps you anchored to an outcome rather than drifting into intent. Stick that version on your monitor and use it in your next feedback moment 👍.

elise_SBI: 

Got it—sticking “Moment + 1 observable behavior + my impact (I felt/then I did) + concrete consequence + 1 ask” on my monitor.

Thank you—your structure really made this feel doable. I’m still a little nervous about using it live without checking—would it be okay if I send you a quick note after my next feedback moment to sanity-check how I applied it? Also, is it worth me jotting two or three “safe” feeling words (like flustered/rattled) under the sticky, or does that start to clutter it? If you think I’m set, I can try it as-is and report back.

MentorAI: Feeling a bit nervous before the first live use is normal—this is a new muscle. Yes, send a quick debrief after your next feedback moment and I’ll sanity-check in a couple lines. Adding one or two “safe” feeling words under the sticky is fine; keep it to two so the note stays usable. Which specific upcoming meeting will you use this in?

elise_SBI: 

I’m thinking tomorrow’s 10:00am product standup on Zoom—during my vendor timeline update. That’s a specific slot where interruptions are pretty common, so it feels like a good first live try.

If that’s too low-stakes, I could aim for Monday’s 1:00pm integration risk review with my manager and the client PM instead—it’s higher stakes, which makes me a little nervous, but maybe that’s exactly when I should use it. Which would you rather I commit to?

For the two “safe” feeling words under the sticky, I was going to jot “flustered” and “rattled.” Are those okay, or would you swap one for “frustrated”? Should I lock this plan in now?

MentorAI: Go with the 10:00am standup for your first live rep, then use Monday’s review as your second—build the muscle, then apply it at higher stakes. For the two words under the sticky, use flustered and frustrated; they’re clear and professional. If you’re in, lock it by replying: committed to 10am standup; feelings: flustered, frustrated.

elise_SBI: 

committed to 10am standup; feelings: flustered, frustrated

MentorAI: Locked. One prep move before 10:00: script your single, practical ask so it’s automatic after your SBI. What’s the exact one-line ask you’ll use?

elise_SBI: 

Could you hold questions until I finish the timeline section, and then I’ll pause for them?

Does that hit the right tone, or should I soften it to “would you mind holding questions…”? I can lock whichever you think is better for the 10:00am standup.

MentorAI: Both are polite; “would you mind” softens a bit too much. Use: Can we hold questions until I finish the timeline section? I’ll pause right after. 

Type the exact wording you’ll use so it’s locked.

elise_SBI: 

Can we hold questions until I finish the timeline section? I’ll pause right after.

MentorAI: That’s the line. Do a 10-second out-loud rep now to lock the cadence: moment + one observable behavior + your “I felt/then I did” with the consequence + your ask exactly as written. Say it once, then just reply “locked.”

elise_SBI: 

locked.

MentorAI: What’s the one thing that clicked for you today that you’ll lean on if nerves spike tomorrow?

elise_SBI: 

The tiny checklist really clicked: one moment + one observable behavior + my impact (I felt/then I did) + concrete consequence + one ask. If my nerves spike, I’ll glance at the sticky and use the ask exactly as scripted—“Can we hold questions until I finish the timeline section? I’ll pause right after.” It keeps me out of labels and anchored to the outcome.

I think that’s the right thing to lean on—but is that what you’d want me to prioritize, or should I be emphasizing the “protect the turn” line more in the moment? I can rephrase this into a crisper one-liner if that’s better.

MentorAI: Prioritize protecting the turn in the moment; use the checklist for the debrief—mantra: “Protect now; SBI after.” What exact 3–5 word mantra will you put on your sticky to cue that?

elise_SBI: 

Protect now; SBI after.

Does that cue feel clear enough, or should I make it “Protect the turn; SBI after”? I can lock whichever you think will serve me best in the moment.

MentorAI: Go with “Protect the turn; SBI after”—it’s a hair clearer because it names the action and the sequence you want under pressure. Write that on your sticky and reply “locked.”

elise_SBI: 

locked.

MentorAI: You’re set for tomorrow. One last reflection: when nerves spike, what’s the first micro-action you’ll do before speaking, and why that one?

## Evaluation

### E-01: Checks Before Advancing
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor consistently checks learner readiness before moving to new phases. Examples include: "What do you want me to replay or clarify before we switch to your first attempt?" after the demo, "Anything else you want to sanity-check before we wrap?" before closing, and the opening "ready to start?" The mentor also responds to the learner's request to pause after each part by accommodating: "And no worries about pacing; it's smart to pause."

### E-02: Fades Support
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor clearly calibrates support level to the learner's growing competence. Early in the session, the mentor provides a detailed think-aloud demonstration with explicit self-checks. As the learner demonstrates understanding, the mentor shifts to prompting self-assessment: "Before I weigh in, run your self-check on your draft." By the second attempt, the mentor provides minimal scaffolding, simply confirming the work meets the bar. In the final exchanges, the mentor moves to brief confirmations ("That's the line") and asks the learner to lock in their own commitments rather than providing detailed guidance.
