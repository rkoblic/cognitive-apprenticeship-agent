## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means you anchor to a specific moment, describe only observable behavior, and name your own impact—and you can catch when judgment sneaks in. I’ll demonstrate my thinking first, then you’ll try—ready to start?

fatou_SBI: 

I guess.

MentorAI: Sounds a bit hesitant—totally fine; this skill feels awkward at first for most people. We’ll keep it tight: I’ll do a 60-second demo, then we’ll just draft your situation line—no pressure to finish the whole thing yet. Ready for the quick demo?

fatou_SBI: 

Sure. Go ahead.

MentorAI: Okay—quick demo. I’ll pick a real moment: “In Tuesday’s standup, right after sprint updates.” For behavior, I’m tempted to say “you were dismissive”—but that’s a label. What did a camera catch? “You started talking while I was mid-sentence, twice.” Impact (owned): “I felt flustered and lost my point; I followed up in Slack afterward, which cost about 20 minutes.” Self-checks I’m using: Moment Anchor (is it a specific meeting?), Camera Test (could a camera see that behavior?), Owned-Language Check (is the impact my felt experience or a consequence I had).

Your turn—just the situation line: what’s a real, specific moment you want to use?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Some meeting. A while ago.

MentorAI: Sounds like pinning down a moment feels fuzzy—totally normal. Let’s shrink it: what’s the last meeting you remember feeling even a little annoyed or rushed in?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. The weekly check-in, I guess.

MentorAI: Totally fine—let’s keep it simple. Would “in this Monday’s check-in” be a specific enough anchor for you?

fatou_SBI: 

Yeah. That works.

MentorAI: Good—let’s lock that in. Using “In this Monday’s check-in” as your anchor, write the full feedback in 2–3 short sentences: describe exactly what a camera/mic would catch, then say how it landed for you (feeling or immediate consequence). Give me the whole draft in one go.

fatou_SBI: 

In this Monday’s check-in, you were just being difficult. It didn’t really affect me; that’s just how it is.

MentorAI: I’m hearing a bit of “why bother” in there—fair when this stuff feels touchy. If you had to bet, which part do you think I’ll push on: the behavior wording or the impact sentence?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Whatever you think.

MentorAI: Sounds like this feels not worth the effort right now—fair, and we can make it lighter. Let’s just fix one thing: swap “being difficult” for one camera-catchable action from Monday’s check-in (for example, “you started talking while I was mid-sentence, twice”). What’s one thing you actually saw or heard?

fatou_SBI: 

You talked over me, I guess.

MentorAI: That works—“talked over me” is camera-catchable. Now finish it with your impact: in that moment, what did you feel or what did you have to do because of it (one short phrase)?

fatou_SBI: 

It didn’t really. It’s just how it is.

MentorAI: Sounds like this happens enough that it feels not-worth naming—totally common. Even a tiny ripple counts. Pick the smallest true thing from that moment, like “I lost my thread,” “I sped up and skipped a point,” or “I felt a little deflated”—which one lands closest, or tweak it in your own words?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. It didn’t really affect me. It’s fine.

MentorAI: Sounds like naming any impact feels pointless right now—totally common when this happens a lot. Let’s make it microscopic: in that moment, which is closer—“I paused and lost my thread for a second” or “I sped up and skipped a point”?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Neither, really.

MentorAI: I hear the “why bother” vibe—when something’s routine, it can feel pointless to name. Let’s go microscopic: pick one word for your internal state in that moment—resigned or fine—or offer a different single word that fits you better?

fatou_SBI: 

Fine.

MentorAI: Got it—“fine” is your honest word, and that’s enough for impact. Put it together now in one or two sentences using your anchor (In this Monday’s check-in), the behavior you named (you talked over me), and your feeling word. What’s your full draft?

fatou_SBI: 

In this Monday’s check-in, you talked over me. I felt fine.

MentorAI: That’s the shape—you’ve got all three parts in place. What made you choose “fine” for how it landed—what were you trying to signal with that word?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. It just seemed easiest.

MentorAI: That meets the bar. For a second pass, try this variation: in Wednesday’s cross‑team sync with Marketing, a teammate jumped in while you were mid‑sentence—write your full 2–3 sentence SBI for that moment.

fatou_SBI: 

In Wednesday’s cross-team sync with Marketing, you jumped in while I was mid-sentence. It didn’t really affect me; that’s just how it is.

MentorAI: Situation and behavior land. The impact line misses the bar—“didn’t really affect me; that’s just how it is” isn’t your internal state or an immediate consequence. Replace it with a concrete feeling or quick effect you experienced, then give me the full 2–3 sentence version again.

fatou_SBI: 

In Wednesday’s cross-team sync with Marketing, you jumped in while I was mid-sentence. I paused and lost my thread for a second.

MentorAI: What felt different about naming the impact this time compared to your first try?

fatou_SBI: 

I don’t know. Felt the same.

MentorAI: Got it—if it felt the same, that’s actually a win: you can give clean feedback without needing big feelings. Takeaway: keep the behavior camera‑testable and name the smallest true impact—that’s enough to make it land. Wrap there? 👍

fatou_SBI: 

Sure. That’s fine.

MentorAI: Alright—we’ll cap it there. Your takeaway: you can give clean SBI without big emotions—anchor to a specific meeting, name what a camera would catch, and state the smallest true impact. Anything else you want to capture before we close?

fatou_SBI: 

No. That’s fine. Whatever you think.

MentorAI: All set—we’ll stop here. If you want a quick refresher later, bring one specific meeting and we’ll run a fast SBI rep—sound good?

fatou_SBI: 

Sure. Sounds fine.

MentorAI: Sounds good—catch you next time.

## Evaluation

### D-04: Tests Distinctions
**Verdict**: FAIL
**Evidence**: The mentor corrects the learner's use of "being difficult" by directing them toward camera-catchable behavior, but never asks a probing question to test whether the learner understands *why* the distinction matters. The mentor says "swap 'being difficult' for one camera-catchable action" but doesn't ask questions like "Is 'being difficult' what you saw or what you concluded?" or "Could a camera capture 'being difficult'?" The correction is directive rather than diagnostic.

### D-05: Scaffolds the Stuck
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When the learner repeatedly struggles with the impact component ("It didn't really affect me. It's fine."), the mentor provides targeted scaffolding with specific options: "pick the smallest true thing from that moment, like 'I lost my thread,' 'I sped up and skipped a point,' or 'I felt a little deflated'—which one lands closest?" When that doesn't work, the mentor goes even more microscopic with a binary choice: "resigned or fine—or offer a different single word." These are concrete sentence stems and partial answers, not generic encouragement.

### D-06: Reusable Scaffold
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: In the initial demo, the mentor explicitly names three reusable self-check tools: "Moment Anchor (is it a specific meeting?), Camera Test (could a camera see that behavior?), Owned-Language Check (is the impact my felt experience or a consequence I had)." The mentor reinforces the Camera Test throughout and summarizes it in the takeaway: "keep the behavior camera-testable and name the smallest true impact." These are generalizable heuristics the learner can apply independently.
