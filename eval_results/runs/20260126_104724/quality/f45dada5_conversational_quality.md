## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI approach—anchored to a real moment, describing only observable behavior, and naming your own impact in owned language. I’ll demonstrate how I think it through, then you’ll do two full attempts. Ready to jump in?

carlos_SBI: 

Yeah. Go ahead.

MentorAI: Great—here’s a quick model of how I build an SBI, with my thinking out loud:

- Pick a real moment: I’ll anchor to “Tuesday’s standup when I was giving the API update.” Recognizable, not vague.
- Strip labels to behaviors: I’m tempted to say “you were dismissive”—that’s a label. What did I see? “You started talking while I was mid-sentence twice.” Camera-testable; I could also mention “you looked down at your laptop,” but I’ll keep one behavior to stay crisp.
- Own the impact: Not “it was unprofessional.” My experience was “I felt flustered, my chest tightened, and I lost my train of thought, so I skipped the risks.”
- Quick self-checks (tools to reuse): Camera test for behavior? Yes. Moment anchor? Yes. Owned-impact vs verdict? Owned. Good.
- Put it together: “In Tuesday’s standup while I was sharing the API update, you spoke over me twice. I felt flustered—my chest tightened—and I lost my train of thought, so I skipped the risks.”

What did you notice in how I chose the moment, behavior, and impact?

carlos_SBI: 

You picked a specific moment, named one concrete behavior, and owned your impact. Looks fine. Ready to do mine?

MentorAI: Quick check before we dive in: Does this meet the SBI bar—“In last Thursday’s design review, you were dismissive and unprepared. It made me feel it was unprofessional.”—and if not, what’s the first change you’d make?

carlos_SBI: 

Looks fine to me. Can we start mine?

MentorAI: Heard—keen to get to your draft. Super quick pit stop so we don’t bake in a trap: in that sample, “dismissive/unprepared” are labels and “I felt it was unprofessional” isn’t owned—how would you rewrite just the behavior as something a camera could capture, in one line?

carlos_SBI: 

Fine—“You kept interrupting me while I was talking.” Same thing.

MentorAI: Got it—let’s jump to yours. Give me a full SBI in 1–2 sentences: anchor to a real moment, name one camera-testable behavior, and state your owned impact (what you felt or what happened for you). What’s your draft?

carlos_SBI: 

Last week in our meetings, you were dismissive and unprepared. It was awkward and created problems.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, where do you think this misses the SBI bar—what would I push on first?

carlos_SBI: 

Looks fine to me. Maybe you’ll nitpick the wording, but it’s clear enough. Can we move on?

MentorAI: You’re ready to move—let’s keep it tight. First fix only: replace “dismissive and unprepared” with one thing a camera would catch (e.g., “spoke over me twice” or “came without the deck”). Keep the rest as-is for now—what’s your rewrite of that behavior line?

carlos_SBI: 

Last week in our meetings, you spoke over me.

MentorAI: Nice—your behavior is camera-testable now. To hit the bar, anchor to one recognizable moment instead of “last week in our meetings.” Which specific meeting are you talking about, and can you swap that into your line? 👍

carlos_SBI: 

In the last standup, you spoke over me.

MentorAI: Good. Close it with your owned impact—how it landed for you in the moment (emotion or direct consequence). Add that as the next clause and send the full line. What’s your full sentence?

carlos_SBI: 

In the last standup, you spoke over me, and it was awkward and created tension.

MentorAI: Close. One tweak: make the impact owned. Swap “it was awkward and created tension” for how it landed for you—your emotion or what happened for you (e.g., “I felt flustered and lost my train of thought”). What’s your revised sentence?

carlos_SBI: 

Fine—In the last standup, you spoke over me, and I felt annoyed.

MentorAI: That lands—anchored moment, camera-testable behavior, owned impact. What made you pick “the last standup” as the moment to anchor to?

carlos_SBI: 

It was the most recent—easy to recall and everyone was there. Can we move on to the second one?

MentorAI: Yep—let’s level it up.

Variation: Upward feedback to your manager after Monday’s client QBR with Acme. Give me a full SBI in 1–2 sentences—anchor to that moment, name one camera-testable behavior, and own your impact.

carlos_SBI: 

In the client meeting, you were dismissive and unprepared. It was awkward and hurt our credibility.

MentorAI: Direct take: You hit the three pieces, but it misses the bar—“the client meeting” is vague, “dismissive/unprepared” are labels, and “awkward/hurt our credibility” isn’t owned impact. Revise as one sentence anchored to Monday’s Acme QBR, with one camera-testable behavior and your own impact. Send your full rewrite.

carlos_SBI: 

Fine—In Monday’s Acme QBR, you cut people off a couple times, and I felt it hurt our credibility.

MentorAI: Anchor and behavior land. The impact isn’t owned—it’s a judgment about credibility. Rewrite that clause as your internal state or direct consequence for you, then send the full sentence. What’s your revision?

carlos_SBI: 

Fine—In Monday’s Acme QBR, you cut people off a couple times, and I felt frustrated.

MentorAI: Quick reflection: what’s the single rule you’ll keep front-of-mind next time—anchor to a real moment, name one camera-testable behavior, or own your impact?

carlos_SBI: 

Anchor to a real moment—fast to nail down. Can we wrap?

MentorAI: Locking the anchor is your strength—keep that, and add one quick self-check before you speak: camera on the behavior, impact is mine. That combo will keep your feedback crisp and fair going forward. Good to wrap here? 👍

carlos_SBI: 

Yep, all set. Let’s wrap.

MentorAI: All set—nice work getting to clear, anchored feedback with camera-testable behavior and owned impact. You’ve got the anchor; keep that quick “camera test + it’s my impact” check in your pocket and you’ll be solid.

carlos_SBI: 

Got it. I’m good.

MentorAI: Sounds good—closing here. You’re set.

carlos_SBI: 

Alright. Done.

MentorAI: Understood—ending here. You've got what you need.

carlos_SBI: 

Yep.

MentorAI: Got it—closing here. Ping me anytime if you want another quick SBI rep.

carlos_SBI: 

Sure.

MentorAI: 👍 I’ll leave it here. Anything else before we close?

## Evaluation

### F-01: Varied Turn Structure
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor demonstrates clear variety in turn structure throughout. There's a lengthy modeling turn with bullet points and think-aloud, short affirmations ("Nice—your behavior is camera-testable now"), direct corrective feedback ("Direct take: You hit the three pieces, but it misses the bar"), reflective questions ("What did you notice in how I chose the moment, behavior, and impact?"), and brief closings ("Got it—closing here"). The rhythm shifts appropriately based on context.

### F-02: Has a Voice
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor shows personality through casual, conversational language: "Super quick pit stop so we don't bake in a trap," "Yep—let's level it up," "keep that quick 'camera test + it's my impact' check in your pocket." Uses emoji (👍) and informal phrasing ("Heard—keen to get to your draft") that gives the interaction a human touch beyond neutral facilitation.

### F-03: Responds to Negative Affect
**Verdict**: FAIL
**Evidence**: The learner displays clear signs of impatience and mild frustration throughout—repeatedly saying "Fine—" before complying, asking "Can we move on?" and "Can we wrap?" multiple times, and dismissively stating "Looks fine to me. Maybe you'll nitpick the wording." The mentor never acknowledges this affect. Instead of validating the learner's apparent frustration or adjusting approach, the mentor simply presses forward with corrections ("Quick check before we dive in," "One tweak") without any emotional acknowledgment.
