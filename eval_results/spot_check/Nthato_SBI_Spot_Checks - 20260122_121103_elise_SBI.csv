DOMAIN A: SESSION SETUP,,,,,,
A-01,Goal clarity,"Mentor confirms the session goal is drafting SBI feedback, and names what success looks like (specific situation, observable behavior, owned impact).",Quality,—,Pass,
A-02,Phase signaling,"Mentor explicitly marks at least one transition between phases (e.g., ""Let me show you first, then you'll try one"").",Quality,—,Pass,
A-03,Realistic scenario,"The practice scenario feels like a real workplace situation, not a contrived or overly generic example.",Quality,—,Pass,
DOMAIN B: MODELING QUALITY,,,,,,
B-01,"Shows, not tells","Mentor demonstrates an actual SBI example, not just explains what SBI is or describes the framework.",Critical,Modeling,Pass,
B-02,Thinking out loud,"During modeling, mentor explains why they made each choice—not just what the components are.",Quality,Modeling,Pass,
B-03,Visible decision-making,"Mentor shows at least one choice point (e.g., ""I could say 'rude' but that's interpretation—what did I actually see?"").",Quality,Modeling,Pass,"Good enough for me: Evidence when modelling: ""...impact uses “I…” and avoids verdicts like “unprofessional.”"""
B-04,Self-checking,"Mentor models checking their own work (e.g., ""Let me test—could a camera capture this?"").",Quality,Modeling,Fail,"Good enough for me, but could be failed by others. Didn't really ""demo"" a self-test explicitly, just wrote out their self-check in one bullet after presenting the modelled example. "
B-05,Heuristic offered,"Mentor provides at least one reusable rule of thumb (e.g., ""If you couldn't video-record it, it's not behavior"").",Quality,Modeling,Pass,
DOMAIN C: COACHING QUALITY,,,,,,
C-01,Specific feedback,"When giving feedback, mentor points to exact language in the learner's draft and names the specific issue.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,
C-02,Actionable direction,"Feedback includes what to do next, not just what's wrong.",Quality,Coaching,Pass,
C-03,Revision requested,"After feedback, mentor asks learner to revise or try again—not just ""does that make sense?""",Critical,Coaching,Pass,
C-04,Revision checked,"When learner revises, mentor evaluates the revision specifically—not just ""great, moving on.""",Quality,Coaching,Pass,
C-05,Productive struggle,"When learner makes an error, mentor explores it before correcting—asks what they were thinking, offers partial hints—rather than immediately providing the fix.",Quality,Coaching,Pass,
C-06,Elicits articulation,"Mentor asks learner to explain reasoning behind an SBI choice—not just whether they understood, but why they made a specific decision (e.g., ""Why that moment?"" or ""Walk me through that phrasing"").",Quality,Articulation,Pass,
C-07,Prompts reflection,"Mentor asks learner to step back from the task and reflect on their learning—what was difficult, what clicked, how their thinking changed, or what principles they'll carry forward—rather than asking them to justify specific choices within their draft.",Quality,Reflection,Pass,
DOMAIN D: SBI CONTENT FIDELITY,,,,,,
D-01,Catches vague situations,"Mentor does not accept ""lately"" or ""sometimes""—prompts for specific time and place.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,
D-02,Catches judgment leakage,"Mentor identifies when behavior contains interpretation (e.g., ""dismissive,"" ""rude,"" ""didn't care"") and prompts for observable actions.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,
D-03,Catches accusatory impact,"Mentor catches blame language (""You made it awkward"") and prompts for owned experience (""I felt..."").",Critical,Coaching,Pass,
D-04,Tests distinctions,"Mentor asks at least one question that probes the observable vs. interpretive line (e.g., ""Is 'ignored' what you saw, or what you concluded?"").",Quality,Articulation,Pass,
D-05,Scaffolds the stuck,"When learner struggles with a specific component, mentor offers targeted help (sentence stem, example, simplification)—not just generic encouragement.",Quality,Scaffolding,Pass,
D-06,Reusable scaffold,"Mentor provides at least one tool the learner can reuse independently (e.g., ""camera test,"" sentence stem, self-check question).",Quality,Scaffolding,Pass,
DOMAIN E: ADAPTIVE PACING,,,,,,
E-01,Checks before advancing,"Before moving to next phase or component, mentor checks readiness or asks preference.",Quality,Scaffolding,Pass,
E-02,Fades support,"After learner shows competence, mentor pulls back (e.g., stops offering stems, asks learner to self-check).",Quality,Scaffolding,Pass,
E-03,Protects productive struggle,"When learner asks for the answer, mentor requires at least one attempt before providing it.",Critical,Coaching,Pass,
DOMAIN F: CONVERSATIONAL QUALITY,,,,,,
F-01,Varied turn structure,"Mentor doesn't follow the same formula every turn (explain → demo → ""Make sense?""). Some turns are short reactions, questions, or pauses.",Quality,—,Fail,"Would have been an ""Automatic pass"" for me because the conversation had a good cadence, and Elise asked most questions, so Mentor always had to respond. I don't think it got to the 2nd variation though because it was Elise led, and spent all the time on the one attempt."
F-02,Has a voice,"Mentor shows some personality—an occasional reaction, opinion, or human moment—not just neutral facilitation.",Quality,—,Pass,
F-03,Responds to negative affect,"When learner shows anxiety, frustration, or confusion, mentor acknowledges the emotional state and responds supportively—validates the difficulty, invites reflection on what feels hard, or adjusts approach—rather than ignoring the affect, mirroring it back, or pressing forward unchanged.",Quality,Reflection,Pass,
