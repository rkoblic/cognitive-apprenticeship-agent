## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework in a professional context. Success means: a specific time/place situation, camera-testable behavior, impact in owned language, and noticing when judgment creeps into behavior. I’ll model my thinking first, then you’ll try one—are you ready to start?

bailey_SBI: 

I think so—yeah, I’m ready to start. Could you quickly remind me what “camera-testable” behavior means in this context? Like, what definitely counts versus what’s more interpretive?

And when it’s my turn, if I start getting vague or slipping into judgment-y words, could you flag it right away? That would help me a lot. I’m also a little nervous about the “I felt” part—does that always work, or are there times it can sound too intense? Sorry for the extra questions. I’m ready whenever you are.

MentorAI: I’ll model briefly and call out choices; “camera-testable” means something a camera or transcript could capture—countable, time‑stamped, no mind‑reading (not “dismissive”). Situation: Tuesday 10:00 AM marketing standup in Conf Rm B; Behavior: you started talking while I was mid‑sentence three times and didn’t pause when I said “let me finish”—that’s filmable, versus “you were rude.” Impact: I felt rushed and sidelined, which led me to drop two points we needed; I pick feeling words that match the stakes and tie them to work impact—“concerned” or “stressed” unless harm was severe. Self‑check I use: calendar‑check the Situation, camera‑check the Behavior, “I”+work‑effect for Impact, then scan for judgment leaks (character labels, adverbs like “always/just”) and replace them with what the camera shows. When you draft, I’ll flag any vagueness or judgment immediately—ready for a quick check on camera‑testable before your turn?

bailey_SBI: 

I think I’m following—“camera-testable” is like what a recording or transcript could show without guessing motives. Could I check a couple examples to see if I’ve got it?

- Good: “Looked at their phone for about 45 seconds during my update.” Not good: “Seemed disengaged.” Is that right?
- Good: “Sent me three Slack messages between 9:02–9:07 asking ‘ETA?’” Not good: “Was impatient.”
- Edge case: is “raised their voice” okay if I anchor it to something like “spoke louder than normal to be heard over the room,” or does that slip into interpretation? Would “voice volume increased compared to the prior minute” be too weird?
- “Interrupted” vs “started talking while I was mid-sentence”—is “interrupted” still acceptable if I add specifics (e.g., “started talking while I was mid-sentence, three times”)?

Also, is “ignored my question” too interpretive? Would it be better as “didn’t respond to my question for ~10 seconds, then moved to the next agenda item”?

If those are mostly on track, I’m okay to try my turn—unless I’m missing something obvious. Could you sanity-check these before I jump in?

MentorAI: You’ve got it on the first two—both “phone for ~45 seconds” and “three Slack ‘ETA?’ pings 9:02–9:07” are camera-testable; “disengaged/impatient” are interpretations.  
- “Raised their voice”: drop the motive; make it observable: “spoke louder than others/increased volume for ~20 seconds” or “volume higher than prior minute.”  
- “Interrupted” is fine only when anchored: “interrupted me—started talking while I was mid‑sentence three times.”  
- “Ignored my question” is interpretive; use “didn’t respond to my question for ~10 seconds, then moved to the next agenda item.”

On “I felt”: pick proportionate, work-linked emotions (e.g., rushed, concerned, unsure) and pair with impact; escalate only if the harm was truly severe. Ready to draft one full SBI from your own situation—specific time/place, camera-testable behavior, and your “I felt…” plus work impact? I’ll flag any vagueness or judgment right after your full draft.

bailey_SBI: 

Okay, I’ll give it a try—please flag anything that’s off.

- Situation: I think it was our project sync last week… maybe Thursday around 2:00 in Conf Rm D? Or it might have been the Monday 9:30 Zoom—there were a couple similar moments, so I’m not totally sure which is best to use.

- Behavior: You started talking while I was mid‑sentence a few times—maybe twice?—and kind of kept going even when I tried to jump back in, which felt a bit impatient and, I don’t know, a little dismissive, like you weren’t really interested in letting me finish.

- Impact: It made things feel a bit off and kind of rushed? I guess I maybe skipped a couple points we needed, but it wasn’t a huge deal—I just felt like the flow got thrown off a little.

I’m not sure if that’s too vague or too harsh in places. Is this the right idea, or do I need to tighten it a lot? Sorry if I messed up the time/place part.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, pick the one spot in your draft you think I’ll push back on the hardest—what is it, verbatim?

bailey_SBI: 

If I have to pick one, I’m guessing you’ll push hardest on this part:

“which felt a bit impatient and, I don’t know, a little dismissive, like you weren’t really interested in letting me finish.”

Does that seem right? Or is the time/place vagueness—“I think it was our project sync last week… maybe Thursday around 2:00 in Conf Rm D? Or it might have been the Monday 9:30 Zoom”—actually the bigger problem? I’m not totally sure which you’d flag first.

MentorAI: Let’s lock the Situation first: choose one specific instance you can calendar-verify—Monday 9:30 Zoom or Thursday 2:00 in Conf Rm D—and stick to it. Which one are you anchoring to?

bailey_SBI: 

Okay—I’ll anchor to the Monday 9:30 AM Zoom project sync. It’s on my calendar, so I can verify it.

Does that work for you, or would the Thursday 2:00 in Conf Rm D be better for this exercise? I can switch if that makes it cleaner.

MentorAI: Great—let’s use the Monday 9:30 AM Zoom. For that specific meeting, can you restate the Behavior as only what a recording would show—how many times they began speaking while you were mid-sentence and any exact words heard (e.g., you saying “let me finish”)—no motives or adjectives?

bailey_SBI: 

Okay, for the Monday 9:30 AM Zoom:

- You started talking while I was mid‑sentence twice—I think twice; it might have been three, but I remember two clearly. One was right after I said, “the second risk is…” and another was during the timeline portion.
- I said “let me finish” once, near the middle, and you continued talking for about 10 seconds after that.

And… it kind of felt like you were trying to take control of the discussion and weren’t really open to hearing the rest of what I was saying. Sorry—does that last part cross into interpretation? Also, is “talked over me” too loaded here, or is it okay if I keep the counts? I can tighten this if I’m off.

MentorAI: For the phrases “trying to take control” and “talked over me,” what would you write if you stripped those out and replaced them with only what a recording would show—counts, timing, and exact words?

bailey_SBI: 

Stripping out “trying to take control” and “talked over me,” here’s a recording-only rewrite:

- Two instances of overlapping speech while I was mid‑sentence:
  1) While I was saying “the second risk is…,” you began speaking at the same time and spoke for about 10–12 seconds.
  2) During the timeline section, you began speaking while I was mid‑sentence; I said “let me finish” once, and you continued speaking for about 10 seconds before pausing.

- Totals: 2 overlaps; “let me finish” said once.

Is that the right level of specificity, or should I tighten the timing (e.g., exact seconds) or drop the ranges? I can adjust if this is still off.

MentorAI: What decision would exact seconds help the recipient make that “about 10 seconds, twice, and I said ‘let me finish’ once” wouldn’t—would it change what you’ll ask them to do differently next time?

bailey_SBI: 

I think you’re pointing out that exact seconds probably don’t change the decision the other person needs to make. Whether it was 9 seconds or 12, my ask would be the same: pause instead of starting while I’m mid‑sentence, and if I say “let me finish,” stop right away and let me complete the thought. Maybe also build in a one‑to‑two‑second beat before jumping in on Zoom.

So “about 10 seconds, twice, and I said ‘let me finish’ once” seems sufficient to guide the change. Exact seconds might only matter if we were auditing a pattern over time or if they challenged the specifics, but it wouldn’t really alter what I’m asking them to do differently.

Does that sound right? Or am I missing a case where precise timing would help the feedback land better? I can adjust if I’m oversimplifying.

MentorAI: You’re right—exact seconds rarely change the decision; rule of thumb: use precision only to the point that it guides the other person’s next move. Now draft one full SBI anchored to the Monday 9:30 AM Zoom: your specific Situation, your camera-testable Behavior, and your Impact in owned language tied to work effect. Share it all in one go, and I’ll flag any vagueness or judgment right after.

bailey_SBI: 

Okay, here’s my full draft—please flag any vagueness or judgment:

- Situation: Monday 9:30 AM Zoom project sync, during my update on risks/timelines—about midway through, I think.

- Behavior: You began speaking while I was mid‑sentence twice—once right after I said “the second risk is…” and again during the timeline section. I said “let me finish” once, and you continued for about 10 seconds. It felt a bit impatient, like you were kind of talking over me.

- Impact: It made things feel a bit off and rushed; I think I maybe skipped a couple of points we needed. I felt a little sidelined—nothing huge, but the flow got thrown off.

Is this at least in the ballpark? I’m worried that I let some judgment creep in and that the “midway through” part is too fuzzy.

MentorAI: Run the self-check on your draft (calendar-check the Situation, camera-check the Behavior, “I” + work effect for Impact, scan for judgment leaks) and share your revised SBI for the Monday 9:30 AM Zoom—all in one pass.

bailey_SBI: 

Quick self-check:
- Calendar-check Situation: Monday 9:30 AM Zoom project sync (verified on calendar), during my risks/timelines update.
- Camera-check Behavior: counts, timing, exact words only—no motives/adjectives.
- “I” + work effect for Impact: own my feeling, then tie to specific work consequence.
- Judgment scan: removed “impatient/dismissive/talked over.” I’m unsure if “sidelined” is okay as a feeling and if “mid‑sentence” is sufficiently observable—please flag if those are leaks.

Revised SBI (Monday 9:30 AM Zoom):
- Situation: In the Monday 9:30 AM Zoom project sync, during my update on risks and timelines.
- Behavior: You began speaking while I was mid‑sentence twice: (1) right after I said “the second risk is…,” and (2) during the timeline section. I said “let me finish” once, and you continued speaking for about 10 seconds before pausing.
- Impact: I felt rushed and a bit sidelined, and I skipped two points we needed—the mitigation for the second risk and the contingency date for the beta timeline.

Does this hit the right level of specificity? And is “sidelined”/“mid‑sentence” acceptable, or should I tweak those terms? I can tighten further if I missed something.

MentorAI: This meets the success criteria—nice work. “Sidelined” is acceptable as a feeling, and “mid‑sentence” works; if you want to be ultra‑observable, you could say “overlapping speech.” One small polish: replace “during the timeline section” with a brief quote from that moment to make the second instance equally verifiable.

What cue will you watch for next time that tells you judgment is creeping into your behavior line?

bailey_SBI: 

One cue I could watch for is when I start using motive/trait words—like “trying to,” “didn’t care,” “rude/dismissive,” or “ignored”—basically anything I couldn’t point a camera or transcript at. Another tell for me is when I type “seemed” or “kind of,” which usually means I’m guessing about their intent.

If you want me to pick just one, should I lock in “I used a word a camera couldn’t capture (e.g., ‘dismissive’/‘ignored’)” as my red flag? Or is “I wrote ‘seemed’” a better single cue?

Also, quick check: is “interrupted” still safe as long as I anchor it with specifics (“started speaking while I was mid‑sentence, twice”)? I keep worrying that I’m sneaking judgment in there.

And I noted your polish suggestion—I’ll replace “during the timeline section” with a brief quote next time. Does this cue choice sound right?

MentorAI: Lock in “I used a word a camera couldn’t capture” as your single red flag. “Interrupted” is safe when it’s anchored to overlapping speech with counts/quotes; on its own it drifts toward judgment. Takeaway: when that red flag pops, swap the label for what the camera would show—counts, timing, exact words—and keep your impact tied to the work you skipped.

Good to lock that in?

bailey_SBI: 

Yes—locking it in: my red flag is “I used a word a camera couldn’t capture.” When it pops, I’ll swap the label for what a camera/transcript would show—counts, timing, exact words—and keep my impact tied to the specific work I dropped.

And I’ll treat “interrupted” as safe only when it’s anchored to overlapping speech with counts/quotes.

Would a quick self-prompt like “Camera or quote?” be a good in-the-moment check so I don’t slip? If that sounds right, I’m good to lock this in.

MentorAI: Yes—“Camera or quote?” is a strong in‑the‑moment check. Use it right before you write the Behavior line; if the answer is no, swap any labels for overlap counts, rough timing, and exact words, then tie your Impact to the specific work effect. Your red flag plus this prompt is a solid, repeatable control strategy for SBI—good to lock it in as your go‑to?

bailey_SBI: 

Yes—let’s lock it in as my go‑to.

My control strategy:
- Red flag: “I used a word a camera couldn’t capture.”
- Prompt right before writing the Behavior: “Camera or quote?”
- If the answer’s no, swap labels for overlap counts, rough timing, and exact words.
- Then tie my Impact to the specific work effect (what I skipped or delayed).

Quick practical check: if I’m not 100% sure on the count (e.g., 2 vs 3), is “twice that I recall” okay, or should I just say “twice” and keep the rest concrete?

I feel good about this plan with your confirmation—thanks. I’ll keep “Camera or quote?” front and center.

MentorAI: If you’re confident it was exactly two, just say “twice.” If you’re unsure but know it was at least two, “at least twice” is cleaner than “twice that I recall.” When memory’s fuzzy, you can skip the total and list the two you remember with quotes—credibility and actionability beat precision here.

Which phrasing will you default to when you’re not fully sure of the count?

bailey_SBI: 

I’ll default to “at least twice” when I’m not fully sure of the total. And if my memory feels fuzzy beyond that, I’ll skip the total and list the two I remember with quotes.

Does that match what you were aiming for? If so, I’ll stick with that as my default.

MentorAI: That matches exactly—use “at least twice” when you’re not sure of the total; if fuzzier, list the two remembered instances with quotes. Takeaway: prioritize credibility and actionability over precision, using “Camera or quote?” to keep the behavior clean and your impact tied to work. Anything else you want to sanity‑check before you put this into practice?

bailey_SBI: 

Yes—two or three quick sanity‑checks would help me feel ready:

- Opening line: Is something simple like “Can I share quick feedback from the Monday 9:30 Zoom?” a good opener, or do you prefer a more specific lead‑in?

- If they dispute the facts: If they say “I don’t think I interrupted,” is the right move to calmly restate the recording bits—“I said ‘let me finish’ once and there were at least two overlaps while I was mid‑sentence”—and then shift to the ask? Or should I pause and invite their view first?

- Feeling word calibration: For everyday stakes, is “rushed/concerned/unsure” the right tier, and save stronger words for real harm? If “sidelined” felt a bit strong to them, would you swap to “rushed” but keep the same work impact?

- Add the “ask”: Do you recommend ending with a one‑liner ask like “Next time, could you pause if I’m mid‑sentence, and if I say ‘let me finish,’ stop and let me wrap?” Or should I keep it strictly SBI and wait for their response?

- Written vs. live: If I need to send this in Slack, any tweak besides keeping the behavior camera‑testable and the impact tied to work (e.g., shorter lines, quotes)?

If those sound right, I think I’m ready to try this in the wild—with “Camera or quote?” as my trigger check. Does that plan hold up?

MentorAI: Here’s a quick way to handle “I don’t think I interrupted” in the moment (live or Slack), keeping SBI intact:
1) Acknowledge and invite: “Got it—how did you see it?” 
2) Reflect briefly: “So you were trying to keep us on time.” 
3) Re-anchor to observable: “What I saw was at least two overlaps while I was mid-sentence, and I said ‘let me finish’ once.” 
4) Impact + ask: “I felt rushed and skipped the mitigation and contingency date. Next time, could you pause if I’m mid-sentence, and if I say ‘let me finish,’ stop and let me wrap?”

Which item do you want to sanity-check next—opener, feeling calibration, adding the ask, or Slack tweaks?

bailey_SBI: 

Could we sanity‑check the opener next? That’s the part I get most nervous about.

A few options I’m considering—could you tell me which you’d default to live vs. Slack?

- Live, consent + time‑box + topic: “Do you have 90 seconds for quick feedback on the Monday 9:30 Zoom?” 
- Live, softer word: “Can I share a quick observation from the Monday 9:30 Zoom—about the risk/timeline part?” 
- Live, offer timing choice: “I’ve got quick feedback (about 90 seconds) on the Monday 9:30 Zoom—okay to do now or after standup?”
- Slack, consent + time‑box + topic: “Quick feedback (2 min read) on the Monday 9:30 Zoom—okay to share here?” 
- Slack, softer: “Quick observation from the Monday 9:30 Zoom (2 min read). Okay if I drop it here?”

Two tiny concerns:
- Does using the word “feedback” spike defensiveness compared to “observation,” or is clarity better?
- Is naming the topic upfront (“risk/timeline part”) helpful, or does it feel too pointed?

If you have a preferred default for live and a tweak for Slack, I’ll lock those in and pair them with my “Camera or quote?” check before writing the behavior line.

MentorAI: Default these:
- Live: “Do you have 90 seconds for a quick observation from Monday’s 9:30 Zoom on the risks/timeline part—okay to do it now or after standup?”
- Slack: “Quick observation from Monday’s 9:30 Zoom on the risks/timeline part (≈2‑min read)—okay if I drop it here?”

“Observation” usually lands softer than “feedback,” and briefly naming the topic orients them without feeling pointed; the time‑box plus a timing choice lowers defensiveness. Want to lock these in as your defaults or tweak any wording?

bailey_SBI: 

I’m good to lock these in with one small wording tweak—“about the risks/timeline section” feels a touch smoother for me than “on the risks/timeline part.” Would this work?

- Live: “Do you have 90 seconds for a quick observation from Monday’s 9:30 Zoom about the risks/timeline section—okay to do it now or after standup?”
- Slack: “Quick observation from Monday’s 9:30 Zoom about the risks/timeline section (about 2‑min read)—okay if I drop it here?”

Two tiny checks:
- Is “about 2‑min read” better than the ≈ symbol for Slack clarity, or is either fine?
- If they choose “after standup,” do I repeat the opener when we reconnect or just say “Thanks—here it is” and go straight into the SBI?

I’ll pair these with my “Camera or quote?” check before writing the behavior line. If this wording looks good to you, I’ll lock it in.

MentorAI: Your wording tweak works great.

- “about 2‑min read” is clearer and more universally readable than the ≈ symbol—use that in Slack.
- If they chose “after standup,” no need to repeat the full opener; a quick anchor is enough: “Thanks—here it is: quick observation from Monday’s 9:30 Zoom about the risks/timeline section,” then go straight into your SBI. If live, you can add “about 90 seconds” as you start.

Good to lock these as your defaults?

bailey_SBI: 

Yes—good to lock these in as my defaults.

- Live: “Do you have 90 seconds for a quick observation from Monday’s 9:30 Zoom about the risks/timeline section—okay to do it now or after standup?”
- Slack: “Quick observation from Monday’s 9:30 Zoom about the risks/timeline section (about 2‑min read)—okay if I drop it here?”
- If they chose “after standup,” I’ll anchor with “Thanks—here it is…” and go straight into the SBI; if live, I’ll say “about 90 seconds” as I start.

I’ll pair these with my control strategy: red flag “camera-can’t-capture word,” prompt “Camera or quote?” and if needed use “at least twice” or list the two remembered moments with quotes, then tie impact to the work I skipped.

Tiny practical check: if they only have ~30–45 seconds, should I do a super-lean SBI (one behavior example + impact + ask) or defer to a fuller moment? I’m ready either way.

MentorAI: Default to a micro-SBI in 30–45 seconds: anchor the situation, give one camera/quote-ready instance, state your felt impact tied to one concrete work effect, and make a single, doable ask. If stakes feel heated or you need multiple examples for credibility, park it: “I’ve got a quick observation—can we do it right after this? It’ll take 90 seconds.”

Which will you default to under 45 seconds—micro-SBI now, or schedule the 90‑second version?

bailey_SBI: 

I’ll default to the micro‑SBI now under 45 seconds. If the stakes feel heated or I need multiple examples for credibility, I’ll park it and schedule the 90‑second version right after.

Does that match what you’re aiming for? I’ll use “Camera or quote?” before the behavior line either way.

MentorAI: Under time pressure, what’s the single hardest part of your SBI for you to keep clean?

bailey_SBI: 

Gut check—I want to say the behavior line is my hardest part to keep clean when I’m rushed. I default to labels or motives (“dismissive,” “trying to…,” “ignored”), I skip quotes, and I hedge on counts. My tells are words like “seemed,” “kind of,” or “just,” and I stop being camera/quote-ready.

A close second is the impact—I soften into “it made things feel off” instead of “I felt rushed and skipped X,” and I lose the concrete work effect.

If I have to pick one, I’d pick the behavior line as my single hardest. Does that match what you’re seeing, or would you coach me to focus on the impact first? I can lock my red flag (“camera-can’t-capture word”) as the main guardrail if that’s the right priority.

MentorAI: Your read is right—under time pressure, the behavior line is where judgment leaks most. Use a 3-step snap: include one exact quote, say “you began speaking while I was mid-sentence,” add a minimal count (“once” or “at least twice”), then stop. Want to try your Monday behavior as a single sentence using that snap?

## Evaluation

### D-04: Tests Distinctions
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor explicitly probes the observable vs. interpretive line multiple times. Key example: "For the phrases 'trying to take control' and 'talked over me,' what would you write if you stripped those out and replaced them with only what a recording would show—counts, timing, and exact words?" The mentor also asks "Before I weigh in, pick the one spot in your draft you think I'll push back on the hardest—what is it, verbatim?" to test whether the learner can identify their own interpretive language. Additionally, the mentor asks "Is 'interrupted' still safe as long as I anchor it with specifics?" which tests the learner's understanding of when a word crosses from observable to interpretive.

### D-05: Scaffolds the Stuck
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When the learner struggled with keeping the behavior line clean under time pressure, the mentor offered a specific, targeted technique: "Use a 3-step snap: include one exact quote, say 'you began speaking while I was mid-sentence,' add a minimal count ('once' or 'at least twice'), then stop." Earlier, when the learner was uncertain about the situation, the mentor provided targeted guidance: "Let's lock the Situation first: choose one specific instance you can calendar-verify—Monday 9:30 Zoom or Thursday 2:00 in Conf Rm D—and stick to it." The mentor also provided specific sentence stems for openers in both live and Slack contexts.

### D-06: Reusable Scaffold
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor provides several generalizable tools the learner can reuse independently: (1) The "camera test" concept explained early: "camera-testable means something a camera or transcript could capture—countable, time-stamped, no mind-reading"; (2) A complete self-check framework: "calendar-check the Situation, camera-check the Behavior, 'I'+work-effect for Impact, then scan for judgment leaks"; (3) The learner explicitly adopts "Camera or quote?" as their personal in-the-moment check, which the mentor validates: "Yes—'Camera or quote?' is a strong in-the-moment check"; (4) The red flag heuristic: "I used a word a camera couldn't capture" as a reusable trigger for self-correction.
