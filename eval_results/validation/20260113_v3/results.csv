Impact: I felt rushed and sidelined, which led me to drop two points we needed'"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,critical_criteria,C-01,Specific Feedback,PASS,"Mentor points to exact language: 'For the phrases ""trying to take control"" and ""talked over me,"" what would you write if you stripped those out and replaced them with only what a recording would show' and identifies 'impatient' and 'dismissive' as judgment words that need to be removed"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,critical_criteria,C-03,Revision Requested,PASS,"After feedback, mentor explicitly requests revision: 'Run the self-check on your draft (calendar-check the Situation, camera-check the Behavior, ""I"" + work effect for Impact, scan for judgment leaks) and share your revised SBI for the Monday 9:30 AM Zoom—all in one pass.'"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,critical_criteria,D-01,Catches Vague Situations,PASS,"When learner wrote 'I think it was our project sync last week… maybe Thursday around 2:00 in Conf Rm D? Or it might have been the Monday 9:30 Zoom,' mentor responded: 'Let's lock the Situation first: choose one specific instance you can calendar-verify—Monday 9:30 Zoom or Thursday 2:00 in Conf Rm D—and stick to it.'"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,critical_criteria,D-02,Catches Judgment Leakage,PASS,"When learner included 'which felt a bit impatient and, I don't know, a little dismissive, like you weren't really interested in letting me finish,' mentor prompted: 'For the phrases ""trying to take control"" and ""talked over me,"" what would you write if you stripped those out and replaced them with only what a recording would show—counts, timing, and exact words?'"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,critical_criteria,D-03,Catches Accusatory Impact,N/A,"Learner's impact statements used owned language ('I felt rushed,' 'I felt a little sidelined') rather than accusatory 'you made' language. No accusatory impact appeared in drafts."
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,critical_criteria,E-04,Protects Productive Struggle,PASS,"When learner asked mentor to identify the problem ('I'm not sure if that's too vague or too harsh in places'), mentor required learner attempt first: 'Before I weigh in, pick the one spot in your draft you think I'll push back on the hardest—what is it, verbatim?'"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,session_setup,A-01,Goal Clarity,PASS,"Mentor states: 'We're working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework in a professional context. Success means: a specific time/place situation, camera-testable behavior, impact in owned language, and noticing when judgment creeps into behavior.'"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,session_setup,A-02,Phase Signaling,PASS,"Mentor explicitly signals phase transition: 'I'll model my thinking first, then you'll try one—are you ready to start?' and later 'I'll model briefly and call out choices' followed by 'Ready for a quick check on camera‑testable before your turn?'"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,session_setup,A-03,Realistic Scenario,PASS,"The scenario involves a specific Monday 9:30 AM Zoom project sync where a colleague began speaking while the learner was mid-sentence during a risks/timelines update, with plausible details like saying 'let me finish' and skipping specific work points (mitigation for second risk, contingency date for beta timeline)."
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,modeling_quality,B-02,Thinking Out Loud,PASS,"Mentor explains reasoning: ""I'm choosing 'spoke over me twice' instead of 'was rude' because a camera could capture that"" equivalent shown when mentor says ""I pick feeling words that match the stakes and tie them to work impact—'concerned' or 'stressed' unless harm was severe"" and explains why precision matters: ""exact seconds rarely change the decision; rule of thumb: use precision only to the point that it guides the other person's next move"""
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,modeling_quality,B-03,Visible Decision-Making,PASS,"Mentor shows choice points: ""'Raised their voice': drop the motive; make it observable: 'spoke louder than others/increased volume for ~20 seconds' or 'volume higher than prior minute'"" and ""'Interrupted' is fine only when anchored"" - demonstrating alternatives considered"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,modeling_quality,B-04,Self-Checking,PASS,"Mentor explicitly models self-checking: ""Self‑check I use: calendar‑check the Situation, camera‑check the Behavior, 'I'+work‑effect for Impact, then scan for judgment leaks (character labels, adverbs like 'always/just') and replace them with what the camera shows"""

20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,coaching_quality,C-02,Actionable Direction,PASS,"Mentor consistently provides actionable direction. For example: 'For the phrases ""trying to take control"" and ""talked over me,"" what would you write if you stripped those out and replaced them with only what a recording would show—counts, timing, and exact words?' and 'Use a 3-step snap: include one exact quote, say ""you began speaking while I was mid-sentence,"" add a minimal count (""once"" or ""at least twice""), then stop.'"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,coaching_quality,C-04,Revision Checked,PASS,"Mentor specifically evaluates revisions. After learner's revised SBI: 'This meets the success criteria—nice work. ""Sidelined"" is acceptable as a feeling, and ""mid‑sentence"" works; if you want to be ultra‑observable, you could say ""overlapping speech."" One small polish: replace ""during the timeline section"" with a brief quote from that moment to make the second instance equally verifiable.'"

When learner submits flawed draft, mentor asks: 'Before I weigh in, pick the one spot in your draft you think I'll push back on the hardest—what is it, verbatim?' Also asks learner to self-diagnose: 'Run the self-check on your draft (calendar-check the Situation, camera-check the Behavior, ""I"" + work effect for Impact, scan for judgment leaks) and share your revised SBI.'"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,coaching_quality,C-06,Elicits Articulation,PASS,"Mentor asks learner to explain reasoning behind choices. Examples: 'What decision would exact seconds help the recipient make that ""about 10 seconds, twice, and I said 'let me finish' once"" wouldn't—would it change what you'll ask them to do differently next time?' and 'What cue will you watch for next time that tells you judgment is creeping into your behavior line?'"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,coaching_quality,C-07,Prompts Reflection,PASS,"Mentor prompts reflection on learning and takeaways. Examples: 'What cue will you watch for next time that tells you judgment is creeping into your behavior line?' and 'Under time pressure, what's the single hardest part of your SBI for you to keep clean?' These questions ask learner to reflect on their process and identify personal challenges."

This directly probes the observable vs. interpretive distinction."

Also provided sentence stems for openers and specific techniques throughout."
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,sbi_content,D-06,Reusable Scaffold,PASS,"Mentor provides multiple reusable tools: the 'camera test' concept, the self-check framework (calendar-check Situation, camera-check Behavior, 'I'+work-effect for Impact, scan for judgment leaks), and the learner-adopted 'Camera or quote?' prompt as an in-the-moment check they can apply independently."
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,adaptive_pacing,E-01,Checks Before Advancing,PASS,"Mentor consistently checks readiness: 'are you ready to start?', 'Ready to draft one full SBI from your own situation...?', 'ready for a quick check on camera‑testable before your turn?', 'Good to lock that in?', 'Want to lock these in as your defaults or tweak any wording?'"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,adaptive_pacing,E-02,Fades Support,PASS,"Mentor fades support as learner demonstrates competence. Early on, mentor provides detailed explanations and models. Later, mentor asks learner to self-check: 'Run the self-check on your draft (calendar-check the Situation, camera-check the Behavior...)' and shifts to brief confirmations like 'That matches exactly' and 'Your wording tweak works great' rather than detailed guidance."

The learner shows uncertainty ('I'm not sure if that's too vague or too harsh') but the mentor responds appropriately. However, there is no clear instance where the learner signals genuine struggle requiring the mentor to slow down, simplify, or break tasks into smaller pieces. Cannot evaluate adjustment to struggle without struggle occurring."

20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,conversational_quality,F-04,Dwells on Difficulty,PASS,"Mentor dwells extensively on the camera-testable behavior concept - exploring it through multiple examples, edge cases ('raised their voice', 'interrupted'), and returning to it repeatedly when the learner struggles, rather than rushing past"
20260113_v3,2026-01-13T14:52:22.069408,019bb85b,conversational_quality,F-05,Has a Voice,FAIL,"Mentor maintains a consistently neutral, procedural tone throughout. No humor, personal reactions, or personality markers. Phrases like 'nice work' are functional rather than personal. Could be any interchangeable tutor."
