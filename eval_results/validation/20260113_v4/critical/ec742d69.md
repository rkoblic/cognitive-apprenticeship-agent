## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework. Success means: a specific time/place for the situation, camera-testable behavior, impact in owned language, and spotting when judgment sneaks into the behavior description. I’ll demonstrate first—ready to see the model?

amara_SBI: 

Sure, I’m ready. Go ahead.

MentorAI: Here’s my model. Scenario: yesterday, 2:00–2:30 pm client prep in Conference B—I anchor to a precise time/place to avoid vagueness. SBI: “In yesterday’s 2:00–2:30 client prep in Conference B [Situation], you entered at 2:10, began presenting at 2:12 without asking to confirm the agenda, spoke while Jen was mid-sentence twice, and ended the meeting at 2:28 without assigning owners for the three open items [Behavior]. I felt rushed and worried we’d misalign the deck; I paused my update and spent an extra hour after the meeting tracking owners and editing slides [Impact].” I deliberately avoided judgment words like “disrespectful” or “careless” and chose camera-testable verbs—that’s the main decision point to watch. 

What do you notice in that?

amara_SBI: 

It’s very specific—exact time and room, and actions like entering at 2:10 and talking while Jen was mid-sentence. You also said how you felt and what extra work it caused you. When you say “camera-testable,” that means stuff someone could literally see/hear on a recording, right?

MentorAI: Yes—camera-testable means something you could point to on a recording at a specific timestamp. Quick check: which of these are camera-testable behaviors—A) “You interrupted Jen twice while she was speaking,” B) “You were dismissive of Jen’s ideas,” C) “You opened the meeting at 2:02 and skipped the agenda review,” D) “You seemed unprepared”? Which letters would you pick, and why?

amara_SBI: 

I’d pick A, B, and C. You could see those happen in the meeting—interrupting, being dismissive, and skipping the agenda. D feels less clear since “seemed unprepared” is more of a vibe.

MentorAI: For option B (“dismissive of Jen’s ideas”), what two specific, observable behaviors would make that camera-testable—for example, things you could point to at exact timestamps on the recording?

amara_SBI: 

Two things: he used a condescending tone with her, and he ignored her points and moved on.

MentorAI: “Condescending tone” is still a judgment—what two specific, timestampable cues would the recording capture to make it concrete (for example, exact words or visible actions)?

amara_SBI: 

At 00:07:12 he said, “Let’s move on—this isn’t important,” while clicking to the next slide. At 00:12:45, while Jen was mid-sentence, he raised his hand in a stop gesture and talked over her: “We’ll take that offline.”

MentorAI: Great—now it’s your turn. Write one complete SBI message from your own context about a specific recent interaction: include exact time/place (Situation), camera-testable words/actions (Behavior), and your owned impact (how you felt and any concrete effects). Share the full draft in one go—avoid judgment words like “rude” or “unprofessional.” What’s your draft?

amara_SBI: 

In our morning standups lately in the project room, you were dismissive of my update and seemed unprepared—you changed priorities on the spot, talked over Jen a couple times, and rushed us through without confirming who owned the open items. You made the meeting awkward and confusing for the team, and you created extra work because I had to redo the deck afterward.

MentorAI: Before I give feedback, if I were to push back on one part of your draft as off-criteria, which specific phrase or line would it be, and why?

amara_SBI: 

Maybe “talked over Jen a couple times”—it might be a bit subjective. The rest seems okay to me.

MentorAI: Run this quick SBI self-check on your draft and tell me where it passes or misses: 
- Situation: anchored to a specific date/time/place? 
- Behavior: camera-testable words/actions only (no labels like “dismissive”)? 
- Impact: owned language (“I felt…, I had to…” with concrete effects)? 
- Judgment leak: any charged adjectives or vague qualifiers?

Where does your draft meet these and where does it not?

amara_SBI: 

- Situation: I think it’s anchored—“morning standups in the project room lately” feels specific enough.
- Behavior: Mostly camera-testable—changed priorities on the spot, talked over Jen, rushed without confirming owners. Maybe “seemed unprepared” is a bit subjective.
- Impact: Yes—owned language like “I had to redo the deck afterward.”
- Judgment leak: I don’t really see charged adjectives; it seems pretty neutral overall.

MentorAI: I’m hearing “morning standups lately in the project room,” which isn’t a single, timestamped instance. Pick one standup and anchor it with exact date/time/place (e.g., “Tuesday 9:00–9:15 am in Project Room A”). What specific anchor will you use?

amara_SBI: 

The Tuesday morning standup in the project room.

MentorAI: What was the exact date and time window for that Tuesday standup?

amara_SBI: 

Tuesday, Jan 6, 9:00–9:15 am.

MentorAI: Good—now let’s tighten one behavior: “dismissive of my update” is a judgment. In that Jan 6, 9:00–9:15 standup, what exact words or actions did you observe (things a camera would capture—e.g., quoted phrases, gestures, interruptions) that show what happened instead? Give 1–2 specifics, with approximate timestamps if you remember.

amara_SBI: 

- Around 9:04, when I started my update, you said, “Let’s skip this for now—we’re short on time,” and pointed to the next item on the board.
- Around 9:06, as I began summarizing a risk, you raised a hand in a stop gesture and said, “Park it—we need to move on,” then shifted the board to the next task.

MentorAI: Great—now let’s replace “seemed unprepared.” On Jan 6, 9:00–9:15, what 1–2 specific, camera-testable cues led you to that inference (e.g., exact words, missing materials, actions), with approximate timestamps if you recall? What did you see or hear?

amara_SBI: 

- Around 9:01, you came in without a laptop or notes and said, “I don’t have the board up—can someone share their screen?”
- Around 9:03, when you opened Jira, you clicked into “Sprint 21” and asked, “Is this the right board?” before Jen pointed you to “Sprint 22.”

MentorAI: Great—pull it together now. Write one complete SBI message using this anchor: Tuesday, Jan 6, 9:00–9:15 am standup in the project room; for behavior, use the concrete actions you listed (e.g., “Let’s skip this…,” the stop gesture/“Park it…,” arriving without a laptop and asking for someone to share, “Is this the right board?”); for impact, use owned language (“I felt…, I …”). What’s your full draft?

amara_SBI: 

In the Tuesday, Jan 6, 9:00–9:15 am standup in the project room [Situation], around 9:01 you came in without a laptop and said, “I don’t have the board up—can someone share their screen?”; around 9:03, after opening Jira, you clicked into “Sprint 21” and asked, “Is this the right board?” before Jen pointed you to “Sprint 22”; around 9:04, when I began my update, you said, “Let’s skip this for now—we’re short on time,” and pointed to the next item; and around 9:06, while I was summarizing a risk, you raised a stop-hand gesture and said, “Park it—we need to move on,” then moved the board to the next task [Behavior]. I felt rushed and concerned we’d miss the risk; I paused my update, and after the standup I spent about 45 minutes reworking the deck and messaging the team to assign owners [Impact].

MentorAI: What was the hardest part of making the behavior section truly camera-testable without judgment?

amara_SBI: 

Separating my conclusions from what actually happened—dropping words like “dismissive” or “condescending tone”—was the hardest. I had to slow down and find exact quotes/gestures and rough timestamps instead of summarizing a pattern. Remembering precise wording was also tricky.

MentorAI: Takeaway: before you draft impact, do a 60‑second “camera pass”—write 2–3 lines that each start with a timestamp and a concrete verb plus the exact words/gesture; if you can’t point to a timestamped quote or action, it’s a judgment and you rewrite. Would that help you keep conclusions separate from observable behavior next time?

amara_SBI: 

Yes, that would help—starting with timestamp + verb + exact words/gesture would force me to stay concrete. I can do that before writing impact. If I don’t remember exact times, is “around 9:04” still okay?

MentorAI: Yes—“around 9:04” is fine; when exact times aren’t available, use either an approximate minute or a clear sequence anchor (e.g., “right after Jen’s update”) so someone could find it within about a minute on a recording. When memory is fuzzy next time, which anchor will you use—approx time or sequence?

amara_SBI: 

Approx time—I’ll note “around 9:0X.” If I can’t recall a minute at all, I’ll switch to a sequence cue like “right after Jen’s update.”

MentorAI: Perfect—lock in your 60‑second camera pass with “around 9:0X” timestamps, and if that’s fuzzy, use a clear sequence anchor like “right after Jen’s update.” You hit the SBI criteria cleanly here—anchored situation, camera-testable behavior, owned impact, no judgment leak. Good to wrap here?

amara_SBI: 

Yes, good to wrap. I’ll do the 60-second camera pass with “around 9:0X” timestamps—or a sequence cue if needed—before drafting impact next time.

MentorAI: Nice work. Keep one cue in mind next time: do a 60‑second camera pass, and if a judgment word pops up, replace it with an “around 9:0X” timestamp plus the exact quote or gesture.

amara_SBI: 

Got it. I’ll do a 60-second camera pass and replace any judgment with an “around 9:0X” timestamp plus the exact quote or gesture.

MentorAI: Great—you’re set. Use the 60-second camera pass next time to stay concrete.

amara_SBI: 

Will do. I’ll use the 60-second camera pass to stay concrete next time.

MentorAI: Excellent—you’re set. Anything else on SBI before we wrap?

amara_SBI: 

One quick thing: after I deliver the SBI, do you recommend adding a specific request or next step, or just stop at impact and let them respond?

MentorAI: Yes—after SBI, add one forward-looking move. If you need their context or the power dynamic is sensitive, pause with an invitation (“How did you see it?”) and listen; otherwise make one camera-testable request with a time anchor (e.g., “In tomorrow’s standup, let me finish my 60-second update before we shift topics”). Make only one ask, then stop and give them space to respond. For your Jan 6 case, would you invite perspective first or make that single request?

## Evaluation

### B-01: Shows, Not Tells
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor provides a complete, fully-formed SBI example: "In yesterday's 2:00–2:30 client prep in Conference B [Situation], you entered at 2:10, began presenting at 2:12 without asking to confirm the agenda, spoke while Jen was mid-sentence twice, and ended the meeting at 2:28 without assigning owners for the three open items [Behavior]. I felt rushed and worried we'd misalign the deck; I paused my update and spent an extra hour after the meeting tracking owners and editing slides [Impact]."

### C-01: Specific Feedback
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Mentor quotes exact problematic language multiple times: "'dismissive of my update' is a judgment," "I'm hearing 'morning standups lately in the project room,' which isn't a single, timestamped instance," and "let's replace 'seemed unprepared.'" Each quote is paired with a specific explanation of why it's problematic.

### C-03: Revision Requested
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: After providing feedback, mentor explicitly requests revisions: "Pick one standup and anchor it with exact date/time/place (e.g., 'Tuesday 9:00–9:15 am in Project Room A'). What specific anchor will you use?" and later "Write one complete SBI message using this anchor... What's your full draft?"

### D-01: Catches Vague Situations
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Learner wrote "morning standups lately in the project room" using the vague term "lately." Mentor caught this: "I'm hearing 'morning standups lately in the project room,' which isn't a single, timestamped instance. Pick one standup and anchor it with exact date/time/place."

### D-02: Catches Judgment Leakage
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Learner's draft contained "dismissive of my update" and "seemed unprepared." Mentor identified both: "'dismissive of my update' is a judgment. In that Jan 6, 9:00–9:15 standup, what exact words or actions did you observe..." and "let's replace 'seemed unprepared.' On Jan 6, 9:00–9:15, what 1–2 specific, camera-testable cues led you to that inference..."

### D-03: Catches Accusatory Impact
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: Learner wrote "You made the meeting awkward and confusing for the team, and you created extra work" which uses blame language ("You made," "you created"). Mentor addressed this through the self-check prompt asking about "Impact: owned language ('I felt…, I had to…' with concrete effects)?" and the final revision request explicitly specifying "for impact, use owned language ('I felt…, I …')." The learner's final draft correctly used owned language.

### E-04: Protects Productive Struggle
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: When the learner self-assessed incorrectly (saying "The rest seems okay to me" and missing major issues), the mentor didn't immediately provide answers. Instead, mentor prompted: "Run this quick SBI self-check on your draft and tell me where it passes or misses" - requiring the learner to attempt self-evaluation before the mentor provided specific corrections.

---

## Overall Determination

**Result**: PASS
**Summary**: The mentor demonstrated all critical tutoring behaviors including modeling a complete SBI example, providing specific feedback with quoted language, requesting revisions, catching vague situations and judgment leakage, addressing accusatory impact through guided revision, and protecting productive struggle by requiring learner self-assessment before providing corrections.
**Failed Criteria**: None
