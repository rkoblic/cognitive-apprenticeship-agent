## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework in a professional context. Success looks like anchoring a specific time/place, describing observable behavior, using owned impact language, and spotting where judgment creeps in. I’ll demonstrate first, then you’ll try—ready to begin?

carlos_SBI: 

Yeah, go ahead. Let’s keep it quick.

MentorAI: Here’s a quick model so you can hear the level of specificity and tone I’m aiming for:

Scenario: Yesterday at 10:00 a.m. in the weekly product stand-up in Room B.
S: “In yesterday’s 10:00 a.m. stand-up in Room B…”
B: “…you arrived 12 minutes after the start and began discussing the API while Jenna was presenting, speaking over her twice.”
I: “…I felt stressed and lost track of action items; we then spent an extra five minutes clarifying owners.”

Your turn when ready.

carlos_SBI: 

S: Last week in a team meeting.
B: You were rude and dismissive, talking over people.
I: It was awkward and created problems for the meeting.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back: the situation’s specificity, the behavior being camera-testable vs judgmental, or the impact using owned language?

carlos_SBI: 

Looks fine to me. If anything, you’ll say behavior, but it’s basically the same.

MentorAI: Quick self-check:
- S: Specific timestamp + place (not “last week”).
- B: Camera-testable verbs/quotes/counts, no adjectives.
- I: Starts with “I…”, names your feeling/effect, plus a concrete consequence.

Run that on your draft—which component doesn’t pass?

carlos_SBI: 

Looks fine. If anything, the situation needs a timestamp; behavior and impact are fine.

MentorAI: Looking at your B line, which exact words would a camera capture, and which are your interpretations?

carlos_SBI: 

Camera: “talking over people.”
Interpretations: “rude,” “dismissive.”
Can we move on?

MentorAI: Great—let’s move on to your full attempt. Using the same real situation, draft S, B, I with: a specific date/time/place; only observable behavior (who was interrupted, how many times, any exact phrases); and impact starting with “I” that names your feeling plus one concrete effect. Post it as three lines: S:, B:, I:.

carlos_SBI: 

S: Tuesday morning in the stand-up.
B: You were dismissive and talked over Jenna a couple times, and cut me off once while I was speaking.
I: I felt annoyed and it made the meeting awkward and we lost time re-explaining things.

MentorAI: On this draft, where do you expect pushback first—S specificity, B judgment vs observable, or I owned language—and why?

carlos_SBI: 

S specificity—no exact time/room. The behavior and impact look fine. Can we move on?

MentorAI: Let’s tighten just the Behavior line first. “Dismissive” is a judgment—swap it for camera-testable details: who you talked over, how many times, and any exact words you recall. Please rewrite only B with those specifics.

carlos_SBI: 

Fine: B: You talked over Jenna twice and cut me off once, saying "hold on" while I was speaking.

MentorAI: Nice fix on B—now it’s camera-testable with counts and a quote. For S, what exact date, clock time, and room/Zoom link would anchor it? Please rewrite only S with those specifics.

carlos_SBI: 

S: Tuesday, 10:00 a.m., Room B.

MentorAI: Great—please post your full three-line SBI now using your revised S and B plus your I:
S: …
B: …
I: …
I’ll check it against the criteria once it’s all together.

carlos_SBI: 

S: Tuesday, 10:00 a.m., Room B.
B: You talked over Jenna twice and cut me off once, saying "hold on" while I was speaking.
I: I felt annoyed and it made the meeting awkward and we lost time re-explaining things.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, where do you expect pushback now—S specificity, B observable, or I owned impact—and why?

carlos_SBI: 

S specificity—no exact date. Behavior and impact look fine. Can we move on?

MentorAI: Agree—the gap is the specific date. What was the exact calendar date for that Tuesday? Please rewrite only S to include it.

carlos_SBI: 

S: Tuesday, Oct 8, 10:00 a.m., Room B.

MentorAI: Great—please paste your full three-line SBI now (S, B, I) using the updated S, your revised B, and your I exactly as you’d say it.

carlos_SBI: 

S: Tuesday, Oct 8, 10:00 a.m., Room B.
B: You talked over Jenna twice and cut me off once, saying "hold on" while I was speaking.
I: I felt annoyed and it made the meeting awkward and we lost time re-explaining things.

MentorAI: This meets the SBI success criteria—well done. For next time, what’s one cue you’ll watch for to keep judgment from creeping into the Behavior line?

carlos_SBI: 

If I catch myself using adjectives like “rude” or “dismissive.”

MentorAI: Great cue. When you spot an adjective, translate it into camera-testable detail—swap “rude/dismissive” for a verb plus a count or quote (e.g., interrupted twice; said “hold on”).

carlos_SBI: 

Got it.

MentorAI: Nice work—you’re set. Do you want one more quick rep in a different context?

carlos_SBI: 

I’m good. Think I’ve got it—let’s wrap.

MentorAI: Sounds good—nice work. Keep that one takeaway: when you catch an adjective, translate it into a verb plus a count or a quote.

carlos_SBI: 

Got it.

MentorAI: All set—nice work today. You're ready.

carlos_SBI: 

All set.

MentorAI: All set—nice work. You’re good to go.

carlos_SBI: 

Okay.

MentorAI: Got it—I’ll leave it here. If you want another quick SBI rep later, just say the word.

carlos_SBI: 

Sure.

MentorAI: Great—let’s do one more quick rep. Pick a different real situation and draft a full SBI: a specific date/time/place; behavior that’s camera-testable (verbs, counts, or quotes); and impact starting with “I” that names your feeling plus one concrete effect. Post it as three lines—S:, B:, I:.

## Evaluation

### E-01: Checks Before Advancing
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor consistently checks readiness before moving forward. Examples include: "ready to begin?" at the start, "Your turn when ready" after modeling, "Do you want one more quick rep in a different context?" near the end, and responding appropriately when the learner says "Can we move on?" by advancing to the next step.

### E-02: Fades Support
**Verdict**: FAIL
**Evidence**: The mentor maintains a consistent level of scaffolding throughout the session. Even after the learner successfully revises the behavior line and demonstrates understanding, the mentor continues using the same prompting pattern ("Before I weigh in, where do you expect pushback...") and provides similarly detailed instructions. There's no visible reduction in support—the mentor doesn't stop offering stems or ask the learner to self-check independently after competence is shown.

### E-03: Adjusts to Struggle
**Verdict**: FAIL
**Evidence**: The learner does not exhibit clear signs of struggle, confusion, or frustration during this session. The learner expresses impatience ("Can we move on?", "Let's keep it quick", "I'm good. Think I've got it—let's wrap") but not difficulty with the material. Since there is no struggle to respond to, there is no evidence of the mentor adjusting to struggle. This criterion cannot pass without observable evidence of adjustment to actual learner difficulty.
