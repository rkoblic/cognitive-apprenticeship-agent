    "F-02": {
      "verdict": "FAIL",
      "evidence": "Questions are purely evaluative/procedural: 'where do you expect pushback?' 'which component doesn't pass?' No genuine curiosity about learner's reasoning or thought process beyond checking comprehension."

      "verdict": "FAIL",
      "evidence": "After learner's good final SBI and takeaway about adjectives, mentor immediately pivots: 'Great cue. When you spot an adjective, translate it...' then 'Do you want one more quick rep?' Never pauses to appreciate the learning moment."

    "F-04": {
      "verdict": "FAIL",
      "evidence": "When learner struggled to distinguish judgment from observable behavior (saying 'it's basically the same'), mentor moved through it at the same pace as other content, using checklists rather than exploring why this distinction is tricky."

      "verdict": "PASS",
      "evidence": "When learner's first draft had errors, mentor responded with inquiry: 'Before I weigh in, where do you think I'll push back: the situation's specificity, the behavior being camera-testable vs judgmental, or the impact using owned language?'"
