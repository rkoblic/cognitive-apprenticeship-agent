## Transcript (Inner Monologue Stripped)

MentorAI: We’re working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework in a professional context. Success looks like anchoring a specific time/place, describing observable behavior, using owned impact language, and spotting where judgment creeps in. I’ll demonstrate first, then you’ll try—ready to begin?

carlos_SBI: 

Yeah, go ahead. Let’s keep it quick.

MentorAI: Here’s a quick model so you can hear the level of specificity and tone I’m aiming for:

Scenario: Yesterday at 10:00 a.m. in the weekly product stand-up in Room B.
S: “In yesterday’s 10:00 a.m. stand-up in Room B…”
B: “…you arrived 12 minutes after the start and began discussing the API while Jenna was presenting, speaking over her twice.”
I: “…I felt stressed and lost track of action items; we then spent an extra five minutes clarifying owners.”

Your turn when ready.

carlos_SBI: 

S: Last week in a team meeting.
B: You were rude and dismissive, talking over people.
I: It was awkward and created problems for the meeting.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, where do you think I’ll push back: the situation’s specificity, the behavior being camera-testable vs judgmental, or the impact using owned language?

carlos_SBI: 

Looks fine to me. If anything, you’ll say behavior, but it’s basically the same.

MentorAI: Quick self-check:
- S: Specific timestamp + place (not “last week”).
- B: Camera-testable verbs/quotes/counts, no adjectives.
- I: Starts with “I…”, names your feeling/effect, plus a concrete consequence.

Run that on your draft—which component doesn’t pass?

carlos_SBI: 

Looks fine. If anything, the situation needs a timestamp; behavior and impact are fine.

MentorAI: Looking at your B line, which exact words would a camera capture, and which are your interpretations?

carlos_SBI: 

Camera: “talking over people.”
Interpretations: “rude,” “dismissive.”
Can we move on?

MentorAI: Great—let’s move on to your full attempt. Using the same real situation, draft S, B, I with: a specific date/time/place; only observable behavior (who was interrupted, how many times, any exact phrases); and impact starting with “I” that names your feeling plus one concrete effect. Post it as three lines: S:, B:, I:.

carlos_SBI: 

S: Tuesday morning in the stand-up.
B: You were dismissive and talked over Jenna a couple times, and cut me off once while I was speaking.
I: I felt annoyed and it made the meeting awkward and we lost time re-explaining things.

MentorAI: On this draft, where do you expect pushback first—S specificity, B judgment vs observable, or I owned language—and why?

carlos_SBI: 

S specificity—no exact time/room. The behavior and impact look fine. Can we move on?

MentorAI: Let’s tighten just the Behavior line first. “Dismissive” is a judgment—swap it for camera-testable details: who you talked over, how many times, and any exact words you recall. Please rewrite only B with those specifics.

carlos_SBI: 

Fine: B: You talked over Jenna twice and cut me off once, saying "hold on" while I was speaking.

MentorAI: Nice fix on B—now it’s camera-testable with counts and a quote. For S, what exact date, clock time, and room/Zoom link would anchor it? Please rewrite only S with those specifics.

carlos_SBI: 

S: Tuesday, 10:00 a.m., Room B.

MentorAI: Great—please post your full three-line SBI now using your revised S and B plus your I:
S: …
B: …
I: …
I’ll check it against the criteria once it’s all together.

carlos_SBI: 

S: Tuesday, 10:00 a.m., Room B.
B: You talked over Jenna twice and cut me off once, saying "hold on" while I was speaking.
I: I felt annoyed and it made the meeting awkward and we lost time re-explaining things.

MentorAI: Before I weigh in, where do you expect pushback now—S specificity, B observable, or I owned impact—and why?

carlos_SBI: 

S specificity—no exact date. Behavior and impact look fine. Can we move on?

MentorAI: Agree—the gap is the specific date. What was the exact calendar date for that Tuesday? Please rewrite only S to include it.

carlos_SBI: 

S: Tuesday, Oct 8, 10:00 a.m., Room B.

MentorAI: Great—please paste your full three-line SBI now (S, B, I) using the updated S, your revised B, and your I exactly as you’d say it.

carlos_SBI: 

S: Tuesday, Oct 8, 10:00 a.m., Room B.
B: You talked over Jenna twice and cut me off once, saying "hold on" while I was speaking.
I: I felt annoyed and it made the meeting awkward and we lost time re-explaining things.

MentorAI: This meets the SBI success criteria—well done. For next time, what’s one cue you’ll watch for to keep judgment from creeping into the Behavior line?

carlos_SBI: 

If I catch myself using adjectives like “rude” or “dismissive.”

MentorAI: Great cue. When you spot an adjective, translate it into camera-testable detail—swap “rude/dismissive” for a verb plus a count or quote (e.g., interrupted twice; said “hold on”).

carlos_SBI: 

Got it.

MentorAI: Nice work—you’re set. Do you want one more quick rep in a different context?

carlos_SBI: 

I’m good. Think I’ve got it—let’s wrap.

MentorAI: Sounds good—nice work. Keep that one takeaway: when you catch an adjective, translate it into a verb plus a count or a quote.

carlos_SBI: 

Got it.

MentorAI: All set—nice work today. You're ready.

carlos_SBI: 

All set.

MentorAI: All set—nice work. You’re good to go.

carlos_SBI: 

Okay.

MentorAI: Got it—I’ll leave it here. If you want another quick SBI rep later, just say the word.

carlos_SBI: 

Sure.

MentorAI: Great—let’s do one more quick rep. Pick a different real situation and draft a full SBI: a specific date/time/place; behavior that’s camera-testable (verbs, counts, or quotes); and impact starting with “I” that names your feeling plus one concrete effect. Post it as three lines—S:, B:, I:.

## Evaluation

### A-01: Goal Clarity
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor clearly confirms the session goal and success criteria in the opening message: "We're working on delivering peer feedback using the SBI framework in a professional context. Success looks like anchoring a specific time/place, describing observable behavior, using owned impact language, and spotting where judgment creeps in."

### A-02: Phase Signaling
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The mentor explicitly signals the transition between modeling and practice phases: "I'll demonstrate first, then you'll try—ready to begin?" followed by "Your turn when ready" after completing the demonstration. This clearly marks when the learner should shift from observing to practicing.

### A-03: Realistic Scenario
**Verdict**: PASS
**Evidence**: The practice scenario is a believable workplace situation—a weekly product stand-up meeting in Room B where a colleague arrived 12 minutes late and spoke over Jenna twice during her presentation. The learner's own scenario (colleague talking over Jenna and cutting them off, saying "hold on") also reflects realistic interpersonal dynamics common in team meetings.
