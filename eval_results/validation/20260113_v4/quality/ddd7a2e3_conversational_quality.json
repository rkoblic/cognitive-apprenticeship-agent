      "verdict": "PASS",
      "evidence": "Mentor asks 'Before I weigh in, pick the one spot in your draft you think I'll push back on the hardest\u2014what is it, verbatim?' - genuinely curious about learner's self-assessment rather than just checking comprehension"

      "verdict": "PASS",
      "evidence": "When learner correctly identifies that exact seconds don't change the decision, mentor pauses to affirm: 'You're right\u2014exact seconds rarely change the decision; rule of thumb: use precision only to the point that it guides the other person's next move' before moving on"

    "F-04": {
      "verdict": "PASS",
      "evidence": "Mentor dwells extensively on the camera-testable behavior concept - exploring it through multiple examples, edge cases ('raised their voice', 'interrupted'), and returning to it repeatedly when the learner struggles, rather than rushing past this difficult concept"

      "verdict": "FAIL",
      "evidence": "Mentor maintains a consistently neutral, procedural tone throughout. No humor, personal reactions, or personality markers. Phrases like 'nice work' are functional rather than personal. The mentor could be any interchangeable tutor."

      "verdict": "PASS",
      "evidence": "When learner's draft contains judgment ('felt a bit impatient... a little dismissive'), mentor responds with inquiry: 'For the phrases \"trying to take control\" and \"talked over me,\" what would you write if you stripped those out and replaced them with only what a recording would show\u2014counts, timing, and exact words?'"
