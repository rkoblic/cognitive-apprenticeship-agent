      "evidence": "When learner struggles with 'dismissive' and 'condescending tone' as judgments, mentor lingers across multiple turns\u2014first asking for two specific behaviors, then pushing back on 'condescending tone' specifically, then asking for timestampable cues. Doesn't rush past the difficulty."
