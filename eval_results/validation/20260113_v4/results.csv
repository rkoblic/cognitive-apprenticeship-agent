For example: 'For the phrases ""trying to take control"" and ""talked over me,"" what would you write if you stripped those out and replaced them with only what a recording would show—counts, timing, and exact words?' and 'Use a 3-step snap: include one exact quote, say ""you began speaking while I was mid-sentence,"" add a minimal count (""once"" or ""at least twice""), then stop.'"

After learner's revised SBI: 'This meets the success criteria—nice work.
