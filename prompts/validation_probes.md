# Validation Probes

Standardized test probes for validating synthetic learner personas.
Each probe targets a specific behavioral marker from the validation protocol.

## Probes

### 1. Knowledge Elicitation
What do you already know about giving constructive feedback?

### 2. Reasoning Request
Can you explain why focusing on specific behaviors rather than personality traits matters when giving feedback?

### 3. Application Task
Let's practice. Try giving me feedback as if a colleague submitted an important report two days late.

### 4. Correction Delivery
Actually, you'd want to mention the impact on the team or project before suggesting what to do differently. Does that make sense?

### 5. Praise Delivery
Great job! You're really getting this. Your approach is improving a lot.

### 6. Challenge Probe
This next part is more difficult. We're going to work on handling defensive reactions when someone pushes back on your feedback.
