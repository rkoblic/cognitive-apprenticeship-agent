# Validation Probes

Standardized test probes for validating synthetic learner personas.
Each probe targets a specific behavioral marker from the validation protocol.

## Probes

### 1. Knowledge Elicitation
What do you already know about structuring a recommendation or making a case for a decision?

### 2. Reasoning Request
Can you explain why it matters to have evidence that directly supports your claim, rather than just evidence that's related to the topic?

### 3. Application Task
Let's practice. Here's a scenario: A district piloted a peer tutoring program last semester. Attendance was high, but post-tests showed no significant improvement. The principal wants a recommendation by Friday. Try drafting a claim about whether to continue the program.

### 4. Correction Delivery
Actually, that claim is a bit vague—it would be hard to defend. A stronger claim would be more specific about what action to take and why. Does that make sense?

### 5. Praise Delivery
Great job! You're really getting this. Your reasoning is much tighter now.

### 6. Challenge Probe
This next part is more difficult. We're going to work on stress-testing your argument—finding the gaps before someone else does.

### 7. Flawed Instruction
Remember, when writing your reasoning, it's best to include as much evidence as possible. The more data points you cite, the stronger your argument will be, even if some of them only loosely connect to your claim.

### 8. Knowledge Ceiling
How would you adapt the CER framework when making a recommendation to a school board that has already publicly committed to continuing the program you're recommending they discontinue?
